skills.ui.json â€” UI projection spec
===================================

- trees: UI panels (3)
- nodes: CourseStep nodes only. Each node has:
    * tree: which panel to render in
    * tier: original tier (1..5)
    * requires: list of {skill_id, min_level} aggregated from AS->CS edges
    * xp: {per_try, per_correct}
    * boss: true for S3 by convention
    * grid: simple (row,col) to seed the layout; refine in FE with dagre/force
- edges: CS->CS 'enables' only (draw arrows)
- version: inherits from source + .ui.v1
