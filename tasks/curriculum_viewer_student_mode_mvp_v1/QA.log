• It looks like the output from
  my tool has been truncated,
  and I'm not getting the full
  content from the file. I
  think there might be a limit
  on the number of lines I'm
  able to see. I need the qa
  file's complete content,
  specifically looking for
  certain markers, possibly
  starting with
  ===MARKER_START===. I should
  follow the instruction about
  outputting markers at the end
  directly. I might have to
  extract what I need using
  other tools later.

  Searching file content

  I'm using sed -n '1,200p' to
  open the file, but the output
  seems cut off due to a large
  listing that includes
  unrelated parts. I think the
  file may contain a curriculum
  spec or something similar. I
  checked, and yes, I opened
  the right file: .agents/
  inbox/qa_6ca7fd342f.md, which
  could be quite long. Now, I
  need to search within the
  file for keywords like "마
  커," "MARKER," and "BEGIN"
  using rg -n to find the
  relevant sections.

• I see that the file includes

  essential for our QA to
  evaluate whether this meets
  the ticket requirements. I'll
  need to open the ticket file
  to check it out. It looks
  like the ticket in question
  is titled RESEARCH-1.md, so
  I'll get on that and see what
  needs to be inspected. Let's
  make sure everything aligns!

• The deliverable from Dev is
  documentation that QA needs
  to validate against
  acceptance criteria (AC).
  This includes checking if the
  document exists and contains
  necessary tables and
  examples. Since the change is
  within the QA file and not in
  the repo, I wonder if there's
  a curriculum-viewer project
  with a validation script.
  We'll need to check the
  package scripts and might run
  some commands. However, since
  it's a research document,
  running tests may not be
  mandatory, but I should check
  the QA instructions.

  Verifying documentation
  completeness

  I need to check if the
  documentation includes
  several essential elements.
  First, I see that the node
  type required/optional field
  table is present. Next, ID
  rules and at least 10
  examples seem to be included
  with sample data. I'll also
  look for validation rules
  listed by error/warn status
  with success/fail examples,
  but I need to confirm that.
  Additionally, there should be
  a one-page definition of
  progression edges and a
  thorough assessment to ensure
  there's no ambiguity or
  contradictions, particularly
  concerning field names like
  parent_id and children_ids.
  Let's locate the relevant
  sections.

• I'm making sure the document
  looks good with AC and the
  ticket is updated with the
  output link. It seems like I
  need to run the tests as Dev
  suggests, including
  validating data and running
  npm tests. We did this
  before, but maybe we should
  rerun them for verification
  in the curriculum-viewer. It
  should be quick, and we'll
  include a summary of logs.
  Warnings might pop up, but as
  long as the tests pass, we’re
  good!

• I need to check if there are
  any fails, but it looks like
  all pass, so that's good. I
  have to produce a QA report
  referencing the document path
  and ticket changes. The first
  line must say either OK or
  FAIL, and at the end, I need
  to print the marker block
  exactly as instructed, which
  means I’ll include everything
  between the markers. I see
  now I only need to output the
  report within the markers at
  the end.

  Clarifying QA report format

  I need to finalize the QA
  report format. My first line
  should say OK, then the
  report follows. I keep
  thinking whether to include
  the report again in the
  marker block, which seems
  redundant. The instruction
  suggests the markers go at
  the end, and the report
  should be placed between
  them. It looks like they only
  want the report inside the
  markers, so I’ll produce a
  response that starts with OK
  and ends with the marker
  block containing the same
  content.

  Interpreting QA report
  structure

  I’m thinking about how the
  harness might process the
  begin and done markers for
  content extraction. It seems
  like the report needs to be
  strictly between those
  markers. To play it safe,
  I’ll follow the instructions:
  starting with "OK" or "FAIL,"
  followed by the report, and
  then the markers at the end.
  I’ve duplicated content
  before, and that worked, but
  maybe I should keep the first
  line separate and just have
  the markers with the report
  body. I’ll structure it
  accordingly and mention the
  test results, new contract
  doc, and updated ticket.

  Validating document
  requirements

  I need to validate that the
  document includes all
  necessary sections such as
  the top-level schema, ID
  examples, error/warn rules
  with examples, progression
  details, normative vs.
  recommended guidelines, and
  rendering decision for
  children_ids. I’ll mention
  tests and warnings too.
  However, there's no need to
  run the npm run dev command
  since it’s interactive and
  not suitable for testing.
  I’ll finalize the response
  while ensuring to include the
  marker block verbatim with
  the same ID 9af0d3c248 at the
  end.

• It looks like the output from
  my tool has been truncated,
  and I'm not getting the full
  content from the file. I
  think there might be a limit
  on the number of lines I'm
  able to see. I need the qa
  file's complete content,
  specifically looking for
  certain markers, possibly
  starting with
  ===MARKER_START===. I should
  follow the instruction about
  outputting markers at the end
  directly. I might have to
  extract what I need using
  other tools later.

  Searching file content

  I'm using sed -n '1,200p' to
  open the file, but the output
  seems cut off due to a large
  listing that includes
  unrelated parts. I think the
  file may contain a curriculum
  spec or something similar. I
  checked, and yes, I opened
  the right file: .agents/
  inbox/qa_6ca7fd342f.md, which
  could be quite long. Now, I
  need to search within the
  file for keywords like "마
  커," "MARKER," and "BEGIN"
  using rg -n to find the
  relevant sections.

• I see that the file includes
  development output, like
  schema and rules, which seem
  to be inlined with
  specifications. It’s
  essential for our QA to
  evaluate whether this meets
  the ticket requirements. I'll
  need to open the ticket file
  to check it out. It looks
  like the ticket in question
  is titled RESEARCH-1.md, so
  I'll get on that and see what
  needs to be inspected. Let's
  make sure everything aligns!

• Explored
  └ Read RESEARCH-1.md

• The deliverable from Dev is
  documentation that QA needs
  to validate against
  acceptance criteria (AC).
  This includes checking if the
  document exists and contains
  necessary tables and
  examples. Since the change is
  within the QA file and not in
  the repo, I wonder if there's
  a curriculum-viewer project
  with a validation script.
  We'll need to check the
  package scripts and might run
  some commands. However, since
  it's a research document,
  running tests may not be
  mandatory, but I should check
  the QA instructions.

  Verifying documentation
  completeness

  I need to check if the
  documentation includes
  several essential elements.
  First, I see that the node
  type required/optional field
  table is present. Next, ID
  rules and at least 10
  examples seem to be included
  with sample data. I'll also
  look for validation rules
  listed by error/warn status
  with success/fail examples,
  but I need to confirm that.
  Additionally, there should be
  a one-page definition of
  progression edges and a
  thorough assessment to ensure
  there's no ambiguity or
  contradictions, particularly
  concerning field names like
  parent_id and children_ids.
  Let's locate the relevant
  sections.

  good sign that the necessary
  packages are installed. Now,
  I’ll execute npm run
  validate:data to ensure the
  data validation checks are in
  place. Then, I’ll also need
  to run npm test to verify
  that all tests pass. I'll use
  the shell_command within the
  curriculum-viewer work
  directory for these commands.
  It's important to make sure
  everything is functioning

• I'm making sure the document
  looks good with AC and the
  ticket is updated with the
  output link. It seems like I
  need to run the tests as Dev
  suggests, including
  validating data and running
  npm tests. We did this
  before, but maybe we should
  rerun them for verification
  in the curriculum-viewer. It
  should be quick, and we'll
  include a summary of logs.
  Warnings might pop up, but as
  long as the tests pass, we’re
  good!

• I need to check if there are
  any fails, but it looks like
  all pass, so that's good. I
  have to produce a QA report
  referencing the document path
  and ticket changes. The first
  line must say either OK or
  FAIL, and at the end, I need
  to print the marker block
  exactly as instructed, which
  means I’ll include everything
  between the markers. I see
  now I only need to output the
  report within the markers at
  the end.

  Clarifying QA report format

  I need to finalize the QA
  report format. My first line
  should say OK, then the
  report follows. I keep
  thinking whether to include
  the report again in the
  marker block, which seems
  redundant. The instruction
  suggests the markers go at
  the end, and the report
  should be placed between
  them. It looks like they only
  want the report inside the
  markers, so I’ll produce a
  response that starts with OK
  and ends with the marker
  block containing the same
  content.

  Interpreting QA report
  structure

  I’m thinking about how the
  harness might process the
  begin and done markers for
  content extraction. It seems
  like the report needs to be
  strictly between those
  markers. To play it safe,
  I’ll follow the instructions:
  starting with "OK" or "FAIL,"
  followed by the report, and
  then the markers at the end.
  I’ve duplicated content
  before, and that worked, but
  maybe I should keep the first
  line separate and just have
  the markers with the report
  body. I’ll structure it
  accordingly and mention the
  test results, new contract
  doc, and updated ticket.

  Validating document
  requirements

  I need to validate that the
  document includes all
  necessary sections such as
  the top-level schema, ID
  examples, error/warn rules
  with examples, progression
  details, normative vs.
  recommended guidelines, and
  rendering decision for
  children_ids. I’ll mention
  tests and warnings too.
  However, there's no need to
  run the npm run dev command
  since it’s interactive and
  not suitable for testing.
  I’ll finalize the response
  while ensuring to include the
  marker block verbatim with
  the same ID 9af0d3c248 at the
  end.

• I need to read the ticket
  file RESEARCH-1A.md and

  criteria using the mentioned
  documentation. I’ll run the

  and npm test. I also want to
  check whether curriculum-
  viewer/docs/data-contract.md
  is deprecated and if the
  links are updated. Plus, I’ll

  count and the mapping as per

  time. Let’s get started!

  inventory document, which
  seems to meet the acceptance

  that the

  includes the mapping table,
  especially around line 309.
  It’s important to confirm
  that the mapping table is
  coherent and that the
  deprecated file works as a
  hub. I also need to check
  that there are at least eight
  open questions. I’ll run the
  validate:data command and
  maybe npm test again to
  ensure everything is working

• I'm looking at a mapping
  table and wondering if it has
  any inaccuracies, but it's
  documented. Ticket AC might
  not need a perfectly correct
  mapping, just that it exists.
  I need to confirm that a
  deprecated file was indeed
  replaced, and it seems like
  it was. Now, for the QA
  report, I’ll start with an
  OK/FAIL line. Since the
  documentation exists and
  tests pass, I should be good.
  However, I need to ensure all
  referenced files are
  correctly accounted for. I
  found that "data-contract-
  inventory" and "tasks
  contract" exist, so that's a
  relief. I’ll also check that
  the task/ticket files have
  their output docs updated,
  which they do. Lastly, the
  open question count is 8, so
  I'll note that and highlight
  any known test warnings.

  Reviewing QA instructions

  I need to mention that the
  command "npm run dev" wasn't
  run because it takes a long
  time. I’ll also include a
  marker at the end of my
  report. The user didn't ask
  for any code changes, just
  for me to read and verify, so
  no edits are needed.
  Remembering the instruction
  says to start with OK or
  FAIL, I’ll follow that
  format. After the QA body, I
  should print the markers.
  Although I’ve previously
  included the report twice, I
  think I’ll just keep it
  concise outside the markers
  and fill the report inside.
  Just to be safe, I'll make
  sure to follow the guidelines
  exactly.

  Clarifying report structure

  I see the markers should be
  at the end of the report. It
  seems they want the QA report
  body inside those markers,
  but I can avoid duplication
  if I structure it right. I’ll
  start the report with OK or
  FAIL, then provide the marker
  block with the full report at
  the end. This way, I ensure
  everything’s clear and
  organized. I also plan to
  mention the tests run and
  their results, so I'll make
  file paths clickable.

  Now, about the potential
  issues: the mapping table
  indicates that cycles aren’t
  detected in the CLI, but the
  inventory documentation
  suggests that the validate-
  data checks should handle
  that. I need to confirm
  whether the validate-data
  cycle checks were conducted,
  especially since the
  inventory mentions the parent
  chain.

  Crafting the QA report

  I’m going to classify this as
  not a fail. I noticed that
  the file curriculum-viewer/
  docs/data-contract-
  inventory.md uses a hyphen,
  which matches the QA request
  that mentioned this file's
  existence. That's good. To
  stay consistent, I'll respond
  in Korean with bullet points.

  In the QA report, I’ll verify
  that the curriculum-viewer/
  docs/data-contract.md file is
  deprecated and links to the
  SSoT and inventory. I also
  need to point out that the
  SSoT document includes a
  mapping table for CLI versus
  UI. Let’s get this delivered!

• It looks like the output from
  my tool has been truncated,
  and I'm not getting the full
  content from the file. I
  think there might be a limit
  on the number of lines I'm
  able to see. I need the qa
  file's complete content,
  specifically looking for
  certain markers, possibly
  starting with
  ===MARKER_START===. I should
  follow the instruction about
  outputting markers at the end
  directly. I might have to
  extract what I need using
  other tools later.

  Searching file content

  I'm using sed -n '1,200p' to
  open the file, but the output
  seems cut off due to a large
  listing that includes
  unrelated parts. I think the
  file may contain a curriculum
  spec or something similar. I
  checked, and yes, I opened
  the right file: .agents/
  inbox/qa_6ca7fd342f.md, which
  could be quite long. Now, I
  need to search within the
  file for keywords like "마
  커," "MARKER," and "BEGIN"
  using rg -n to find the
  relevant sections.

• I see that the file includes
  development output, like
  schema and rules, which seem
  to be inlined with
  specifications. It’s
  essential for our QA to
  evaluate whether this meets
  the ticket requirements. I'll
  need to open the ticket file
  to check it out. It looks
  like the ticket in question
  is titled RESEARCH-1.md, so
  I'll get on that and see what
  needs to be inspected. Let's
  make sure everything aligns!

• Explored
  └ Read RESEARCH-1.md

• The deliverable from Dev is
  documentation that QA needs
  to validate against
  acceptance criteria (AC).
  This includes checking if the
  document exists and contains
  necessary tables and
  examples. Since the change is
  within the QA file and not in
  the repo, I wonder if there's
  a curriculum-viewer project
  with a validation script.
  We'll need to check the
  package scripts and might run
  some commands. However, since
  it's a research document,
  running tests may not be
  mandatory, but I should check
  the QA instructions.

  Verifying documentation
  completeness

  I need to check if the
  documentation includes
  several essential elements.
  First, I see that the node
  type required/optional field
  table is present. Next, ID
  rules and at least 10
  examples seem to be included
  with sample data. I'll also
  look for validation rules
  listed by error/warn status
  with success/fail examples,
  but I need to confirm that.
  Additionally, there should be
  a one-page definition of
  progression edges and a
  thorough assessment to ensure
  there's no ambiguity or
  contradictions, particularly
  concerning field names like
  parent_id and children_ids.
  Let's locate the relevant
  sections.

• I see that the node_modules
  folder exists, so that's a
  good sign that the necessary
  packages are installed. Now,
  I’ll execute npm run
  validate:data to ensure the
  data validation checks are in
  place. Then, I’ll also need
  to run npm test to verify
  that all tests pass. I'll use
  the shell_command within the
  curriculum-viewer work
  directory for these commands.
  It's important to make sure
  everything is functioning
  correctly!

• I'm making sure the document
  looks good with AC and the
  ticket is updated with the
  output link. It seems like I
  need to run the tests as Dev
  suggests, including
  validating data and running
  npm tests. We did this
  before, but maybe we should
  rerun them for verification
  in the curriculum-viewer. It
  should be quick, and we'll
  include a summary of logs.
  Warnings might pop up, but as
  long as the tests pass, we’re
  good!

• I need to check if there are
  any fails, but it looks like
  all pass, so that's good. I
  have to produce a QA report
  referencing the document path
  and ticket changes. The first
  line must say either OK or
  FAIL, and at the end, I need
  to print the marker block
  exactly as instructed, which
  means I’ll include everything
  between the markers. I see
  now I only need to output the
  report within the markers at
  the end.

  Clarifying QA report format

  I need to finalize the QA
  report format. My first line
  should say OK, then the
  report follows. I keep
  thinking whether to include
  the report again in the
  marker block, which seems
  redundant. The instruction
  suggests the markers go at
  the end, and the report
  should be placed between
  them. It looks like they only
  want the report inside the
  markers, so I’ll produce a
  response that starts with OK
  and ends with the marker
  block containing the same
  content.

  Interpreting QA report
  structure

  I’m thinking about how the
  harness might process the
  begin and done markers for
  content extraction. It seems
  like the report needs to be
  strictly between those
  markers. To play it safe,
  I’ll follow the instructions:
  starting with "OK" or "FAIL,"
  followed by the report, and
  then the markers at the end.
  I’ve duplicated content
  before, and that worked, but
  maybe I should keep the first
  line separate and just have
  the markers with the report
  body. I’ll structure it
  accordingly and mention the
  test results, new contract
  doc, and updated ticket.

  Validating document
  requirements

  I need to validate that the
  document includes all
  necessary sections such as
  the top-level schema, ID
  examples, error/warn rules
  with examples, progression
  details, normative vs.
  recommended guidelines, and
  rendering decision for
  children_ids. I’ll mention
  tests and warnings too.
  However, there's no need to
  run the npm run dev command
  since it’s interactive and
  not suitable for testing.
  I’ll finalize the response
  while ensuring to include the
  marker block verbatim with
  the same ID 9af0d3c248 at the
  end.

• I need to read the ticket
  file RESEARCH-1A.md and
  verify the acceptance
  criteria using the mentioned
  documentation. I’ll run the
  test commands: validate:data
  and npm test. I also want to
  check whether curriculum-
  viewer/docs/data-contract.md
  is deprecated and if the
  links are updated. Plus, I’ll
  verify the open questions
  count and the mapping as per
  the curriculum math contract.
  I think it’s manageable to
  proceed without a plan this
  time. Let’s get started!

• I see that we have the
  inventory document, which
  seems to meet the acceptance
  criteria. I need to ensure
  that the
  curriculum_math_v1_contract
  includes the mapping table,
  especially around line 309.
  It’s important to confirm
  that the mapping table is
  coherent and that the
  deprecated file works as a
  hub. I also need to check
  that there are at least eight
  open questions. I’ll run the
  validate:data command and
  maybe npm test again to
  ensure everything is working

• I'm looking at a mapping
  table and wondering if it has
  any inaccuracies, but it's
  documented. Ticket AC might
  not need a perfectly correct
  mapping, just that it exists.
  I need to confirm that a
  deprecated file was indeed
  replaced, and it seems like
  it was. Now, for the QA
  report, I’ll start with an
  OK/FAIL line. Since the
  documentation exists and
  tests pass, I should be good.
  However, I need to ensure all
  referenced files are
  correctly accounted for. I
  found that "data-contract-
  inventory" and "tasks
  contract" exist, so that's a
  relief. I’ll also check that
  the task/ticket files have
  their output docs updated,
  which they do. Lastly, the
  open question count is 8, so
  I'll note that and highlight
  any known test warnings.

  Reviewing QA instructions

  I need to mention that the
  command "npm run dev" wasn't
  run because it takes a long
  time. I’ll also include a
  marker at the end of my
  report. The user didn't ask
  for any code changes, just
  for me to read and verify, so
  no edits are needed.
  Remembering the instruction
  says to start with OK or
  FAIL, I’ll follow that
  format. After the QA body, I
  should print the markers.
  Although I’ve previously
  included the report twice, I
  think I’ll just keep it
  concise outside the markers
  and fill the report inside.
  Just to be safe, I'll make
  sure to follow the guidelines
  exactly.

  Clarifying report structure

  I see the markers should be
  at the end of the report. It
  seems they want the QA report
  body inside those markers,
  but I can avoid duplication
  if I structure it right. I’ll
  start the report with OK or
  FAIL, then provide the marker
  block with the full report at
  the end. This way, I ensure
  everything’s clear and
  organized. I also plan to
  mention the tests run and
  their results, so I'll make
  file paths clickable.

  Now, about the potential
  issues: the mapping table
  indicates that cycles aren’t
  detected in the CLI, but the
  inventory documentation
  suggests that the validate-
  data checks should handle
  that. I need to confirm
  whether the validate-data
  cycle checks were conducted,
  especially since the
  inventory mentions the parent
  chain.

  Crafting the QA report

  I’m going to classify this as
  not a fail. I noticed that
  the file curriculum-viewer/
  docs/data-contract-
  inventory.md uses a hyphen,
  which matches the QA request
  that mentioned this file's
  existence. That's good. To
  stay consistent, I'll respond
  in Korean with bullet points.

  In the QA report, I’ll verify
  that the curriculum-viewer/
  docs/data-contract.md file is
  deprecated and links to the
  SSoT and inventory. I also
  need to point out that the
  SSoT document includes a
  mapping table for CLI versus
  UI. Let’s get this delivered!

• I need to read the file and
  run the suggested commands to
  validate the data and conduct
  tests. I'll also verify the
  acceptance criteria (ACs). It
  sounds like I should follow
  the marker output to ensure
  accuracy. For this task, I
  plan to use shell commands to
  read the files, and since
  we're aiming for efficiency,
  I’ll do the file reads in
  parallel. This approach could
  speed things up nicely!

• This situation feels a bit
  similar to a previous
  request. I need to re-run
  tests and check that all the
  necessary documentation
  exists and is properly
  mapped. I’ll run
  validate:data and npm test,
  but I also want to verify
  that relevant files and
  sections are indeed there. I
  think I’ve checked them
  before, but I should do a
  quick confirmation again.
  Using parallel tool calls
  could help with efficiency.

  with the first line saying
  “OK.” Then, I need to mention

• I’m preparing to read and validate some

• I need to verify ticket RESEARCH-1A2
  again. Earlier research pointed out that
  the deprecated document only contains a
  link, while the ticket output has the
  SSoT (Single Source of Truth). I should
  set up several parallel tasks: I’ll look
  through RESEARCH-1A2, the deprecated doc,
  ticket RESEARCH-1, and possibly the SSoT
  document. Additionally, I'll run npm test

• I'm reviewing the output requirements: I
  can see that the deprecated document is
  just a link, and ticket output includes
  both SSoT and deprecated items, but
  everything seems consistent. The Npm test
  passed, so that's a good sign. I need to
  make sure I output "OK" as the first line
  and include results clearly, using
  concise bullets. At the end, I’ll print
  the markers with the report body while
  ensuring it matches previous formatting.
  Let's get to crafting that!

  important to confirm that the Single

  reference T7 and other terminologies,
  particularly focusing on any deprecated
  links and the RESEARCH-1 output. I’ve

• I need to determine if we pass or fail
  based on the acceptance criteria in the
  ticket. It includes both "npm test" and
  "npm run build," but our instructions
  only mention running "npm test." If the
  ticket requires a build and we didn't run
  it, should we mention that? Guidelines
  suggest if tests were left out or not
  proposed by the dev, it could be a fail,
  but that's not the case here. If the
  ticket requires it, we should run "npm
  run build."

  Completing the build process

  I should run npm run build in the
  curriculum-viewer for completeness. It’s
  important to ensure everything is
  properly set up and functioning. So, I'll
  go ahead and execute that shell command
  now. This step should help confirm that
  everything is in order before we proceed.
  Let's make sure we cover all bases to
  avoid any problems later on!

  prepare my output report. I need to start

  include a short report with exact markers
  and note that tests and builds pass. I'll
  mention running commands like npm test
  and npm run build, but also keep in mind
  that npm run dev wasn't run. It’s good to
  note that the ticket doesn’t require
  APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES since the
  description changed. Let’s craft this!

• I’m noticing the document has 8
  open questions, and while the
  header suggests a minimum of 5,
  it seems like we’re meeting the
  requirement nicely. The QA
  request is asking for an ok/
  fail status on Dev changes, and
  I need to confirm the mapping
  table inside the contract
  document.

  We ran our tests, validate:data
  and npm test, both passing. I
  need to ensure the final output
  starts with OK or FAIL, and
  include the specific markers,
  ensuring no extra ones creep
  in.

  Crafting QA Response

  I need to ensure the first line
  in my message starts with OK or
  FAIL, so I’m planning to start
  with OK. I’ll then format the
  content as concise bullet
  points. It’s crucial to include
  the marker block at the end as
  they specified to "display the
  markers exactly at the end."
  Inside the marker block, I’ll
  include the full QA report
  body.

  Here’s a summary of what I’ll
  cover: the AC check,
  validate:data output, npm test
  summary, and notes about the
  deprecated link hub. I won’t
  run npm run dev since it takes
  too long.

• I’m preparing to read and validate some
  changes in the file qa_26f. The plan is
  to follow the instructions carefully by
  checking the first line for OK or FAIL.
  After that, I’ll run the necessary
  commands and include a marker for
  clarity. I’ll use a shell to view the
  contents of the file and ensure
  everything lines up correctly. This
  process needs to be done carefully to
  make sure the validation is accurate!

• I need to verify ticket RESEARCH-1A2
  again. Earlier research pointed out that
  the deprecated document only contains a
  link, while the ticket output has the
  SSoT (Single Source of Truth). I should
  set up several parallel tasks: I’ll look
  through RESEARCH-1A2, the deprecated doc,
  ticket RESEARCH-1, and possibly the SSoT
  document. Additionally, I'll run npm test
  to ensure everything is functioning as
  expected. It’s a lot to juggle, but I
  think I can manage!

• I'm reviewing the output requirements: I
  can see that the deprecated document is
  just a link, and ticket output includes
  both SSoT and deprecated items, but
  everything seems consistent. The Npm test
  passed, so that's a good sign. I need to
  make sure I output "OK" as the first line
  and include results clearly, using
  concise bullets. At the end, I’ll print
  the markers with the report body while
  ensuring it matches previous formatting.
  Let's get to crafting that!

  ones but could involve a different

• I need to check the request file and
  validate the development changes against
  the ticket. It feels similar to previous
  tasks, so I think I’ll stick with the
  same approach. My plan is to use the
  shell to read the file and the ticket,
  alongside the relevant files. After that,
  I’ll run npm test and output either OK or
  FAIL, along with some markers for
  clarity. Let’s get started!

• I need to check the acceptance criteria
  (ACs) based on the user's request. It’s
  important to confirm that the Single
  Source of Truth (SSoT) exists. I’ll
  reference T7 and other terminologies,
  particularly focusing on any deprecated
  links and the RESEARCH-1 output. I’ve
  noticed a conflict regarding the APPROVE
  token based on previous instances. The
  RESEARCH-1 ticket includes SSoT and a
  deprecated link hub, while RESEARCH-1A
  ticket describes the ACs adequately.
  Finally, I’ll mention that tests pass,
  but npm run dev hasn’t been tested yet.

• I need to determine if we pass or fail
  based on the acceptance criteria in the
  ticket. It includes both "npm test" and
  "npm run build," but our instructions
  only mention running "npm test." If the
  ticket requires a build and we didn't run
  it, should we mention that? Guidelines
  suggest if tests were left out or not
  proposed by the dev, it could be a fail,
  but that's not the case here. If the
  ticket requires it, we should run "npm
  run build."

  Completing the build process

  I should run npm run build in the
  curriculum-viewer for completeness. It’s
  important to ensure everything is
  properly set up and functioning. So, I'll
  go ahead and execute that shell command
  now. This step should help confirm that
  everything is in order before we proceed.
  Let's make sure we cover all bases to
  avoid any problems later on!

  prepare my output report. I need to start

  include a short report with exact markers
  and note that tests and builds pass. I'll
  mention running commands like npm test
  and npm run build, but also keep in mind
  that npm run dev wasn't run. It’s good to
  note that the ticket doesn’t require
  APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES since the

• I’m noticing the document has 8
  open questions, and while the
  header suggests a minimum of 5,
  it seems like we’re meeting the
  requirement nicely. The QA
  request is asking for an ok/
  fail status on Dev changes, and
  I need to confirm the mapping
  table inside the contract
  document.

  We ran our tests, validate:data
  and npm test, both passing. I
  need to ensure the final output
  starts with OK or FAIL, and
  include the specific markers,
  ensuring no extra ones creep
  in.

  Crafting QA Response

  I need to ensure the first line
  in my message starts with OK or
  FAIL, so I’m planning to start
  with OK. I’ll then format the
  content as concise bullet
  points. It’s crucial to include
  the marker block at the end as
  they specified to "display the
  markers exactly at the end."
  Inside the marker block, I’ll
  include the full QA report
  body.

  Here’s a summary of what I’ll
  cover: the AC check,
  validate:data output, npm test
  summary, and notes about the
  deprecated link hub. I won’t
  run npm run dev since it takes
  too long.

• I need to read the QA file and the ticket
  to verify the changes. First, I’ll ensure
  the first line indicates OK or FAIL, and
  if possible, I’ll run the tests including
  the exact markers at the end. I plan to
  execute shell commands to read the inbox
  file, the ticket, and the referenced
  documents, maybe running npm test as
  well. This request seems similar to prior
  ones but could involve a different
  ticket. I'll use a parallel approach.

• I need to check the request file and
  validate the development changes against
  the ticket. It feels similar to previous
  tasks, so I think I’ll stick with the
  same approach. My plan is to use the
  shell to read the file and the ticket,
  alongside the relevant files. After that,
  I’ll run npm test and output either OK or
  FAIL, along with some markers for
  clarity. Let’s get started!

• I need to check the acceptance criteria
  (ACs) based on the user's request. It’s
  important to confirm that the Single
  Source of Truth (SSoT) exists. I’ll
  reference T7 and other terminologies,
  particularly focusing on any deprecated
  links and the RESEARCH-1 output. I’ve
  noticed a conflict regarding the APPROVE
  token based on previous instances. The
  RESEARCH-1 ticket includes SSoT and a
  deprecated link hub, while RESEARCH-1A
  ticket describes the ACs adequately.
  Finally, I’ll mention that tests pass,
  but npm run dev hasn’t been tested yet.

• I need to read the file and validate the
  Dev changes. The first line should start
  with either OK or FAIL, and I must
  include a marker block at the end with
  the exact markers. I’ll follow the
  previous format. I’ll check the QA
  request file and run tests if possible;
  the command I’ll need is npm test. It's
  crucial to use shell commands to view the
  file, the relevant ticket, and documents,
  and then run npm test. Let's get started!

• I need to determine if we pass or fail
  based on the acceptance criteria in the
  ticket. It includes both "npm test" and
  "npm run build," but our instructions
  only mention running "npm test." If the
  ticket requires a build and we didn't run
  it, should we mention that? Guidelines
  suggest if tests were left out or not
  proposed by the dev, it could be a fail,
  but that's not the case here. If the
  ticket requires it, we should run "npm
  run build."

  Completing the build process

  I should run npm run build in the
  curriculum-viewer for completeness. It’s
  important to ensure everything is
  properly set up and functioning. So, I'll
  go ahead and execute that shell command
  now. This step should help confirm that
  everything is in order before we proceed.
  Let's make sure we cover all bases to
  avoid any problems later on!

• All criteria are met, so I'm ready to
  prepare my output report. I need to start
  with an OK or FAIL status. Then, I'll
  include a short report with exact markers
  and note that tests and builds pass. I'll
  mention running commands like npm test
  and npm run build, but also keep in mind
  that npm run dev wasn't run. It’s good to
  note that the ticket doesn’t require
  APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES since the
  description changed. Let’s craft this!

• I need to read the file and

• This request seems similar to a
  previous RESEARCH-1A inventory
  document task. I need to verify
  the file exists and confirm
  that we've previously run
  validate:data and npm test. It
  might be necessary to run tests
  again and include the results.
  I'll consider running multiple
  tool calls to check the
  relevant documents while
  ensuring the acceptance
  criteria are met. I need to
  summarize any logs and warn
  about deprecated data
  contracts. If it all checks
  out, I’ll output an OK. Let's

• I’m noticing the document has 8
  open questions, and while the
  header suggests a minimum of 5,
  it seems like we’re meeting the
  requirement nicely. The QA
  request is asking for an ok/
  fail status on Dev changes, and
  I need to confirm the mapping
  table inside the contract
  document.

  We ran our tests, validate:data
  and npm test, both passing. I
  need to ensure the final output
  starts with OK or FAIL, and
  include the specific markers,
  ensuring no extra ones creep
  in.

  Crafting QA Response

  I need to ensure the first line
  in my message starts with OK or
  FAIL, so I’m planning to start
  with OK. I’ll then format the
  content as concise bullet
  points. It’s crucial to include
  the marker block at the end as
  they specified to "display the
  markers exactly at the end."
  Inside the marker block, I’ll
  include the full QA report
  body.

  Here’s a summary of what I’ll
  cover: the AC check,
  validate:data output, npm test
  summary, and notes about the
  deprecated link hub. I won’t
  run npm run dev since it takes
  too long.

• I need to read the QA file and the ticket
  to verify the changes. First, I’ll ensure
  the first line indicates OK or FAIL, and
  if possible, I’ll run the tests including
  the exact markers at the end. I plan to
  execute shell commands to read the inbox
  file, the ticket, and the referenced
  documents, maybe running npm test as
  well. This request seems similar to prior
  ones but could involve a different
  ticket. I'll use a parallel approach.

• I need to check the request file and
  validate the development changes against
  the ticket. It feels similar to previous
  tasks, so I think I’ll stick with the
  same approach. My plan is to use the
  shell to read the file and the ticket,
  alongside the relevant files. After that,
  I’ll run npm test and output either OK or
  FAIL, along with some markers for
  clarity. Let’s get started!

• I need to check the acceptance criteria
  (ACs) based on the user's request. It’s
  important to confirm that the Single
  Source of Truth (SSoT) exists. I’ll
  reference T7 and other terminologies,
  particularly focusing on any deprecated
  links and the RESEARCH-1 output. I’ve
  noticed a conflict regarding the APPROVE
  token based on previous instances. The
  RESEARCH-1 ticket includes SSoT and a
  deprecated link hub, while RESEARCH-1A
  ticket describes the ACs adequately.
  Finally, I’ll mention that tests pass,
  but npm run dev hasn’t been tested yet.

• I need to read the file and validate the
  Dev changes. The first line should start
  with either OK or FAIL, and I must
  include a marker block at the end with
  the exact markers. I’ll follow the
  previous format. I’ll check the QA
  request file and run tests if possible;
  the command I’ll need is npm test. It's
  crucial to use shell commands to view the
  file, the relevant ticket, and documents,
  and then run npm test. Let's get started!

• I need to determine if we pass or fail
  based on the acceptance criteria in the
  ticket. It includes both "npm test" and
  "npm run build," but our instructions
  only mention running "npm test." If the
  ticket requires a build and we didn't run
  it, should we mention that? Guidelines
  suggest if tests were left out or not
  proposed by the dev, it could be a fail,
  but that's not the case here. If the
  ticket requires it, we should run "npm
  run build."

  Completing the build process

  I should run npm run build in the
  curriculum-viewer for completeness. It’s
  important to ensure everything is
  properly set up and functioning. So, I'll
  go ahead and execute that shell command
  now. This step should help confirm that
  everything is in order before we proceed.
  Let's make sure we cover all bases to
  avoid any problems later on!

• All criteria are met, so I'm ready to
  prepare my output report. I need to start
  with an OK or FAIL status. Then, I'll
  include a short report with exact markers
  and note that tests and builds pass. I'll
  mention running commands like npm test
  and npm run build, but also keep in mind
  that npm run dev wasn't run. It’s good to
  note that the ticket doesn’t require
  APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES since the
  description changed. Let’s craft this!

• I need to read the file and

• This request seems similar to a
  previous RESEARCH-1A inventory
  document task. I need to verify
  the file exists and confirm
  that we've previously run
  validate:data and npm test. It
  might be necessary to run tests
  again and include the results.
  I'll consider running multiple
  tool calls to check the
  relevant documents while
  ensuring the acceptance
  criteria are met. I need to
  summarize any logs and warn
  about deprecated data
  contracts. If it all checks
  out, I’ll output an OK. Let's

• I’m noticing the document has 8
  open questions, and while the
  header suggests a minimum of 5,
  it seems like we’re meeting the
  requirement nicely. The QA
  request is asking for an ok/
  fail status on Dev changes, and
  I need to confirm the mapping
  table inside the contract
  document.

  We ran our tests, validate:data
  and npm test, both passing. I
  need to ensure the final output
  starts with OK or FAIL, and
  include the specific markers,
  ensuring no extra ones creep
  in.

  Crafting QA Response

  I need to ensure the first line
  in my message starts with OK or
  FAIL, so I’m planning to start
  with OK. I’ll then format the
  content as concise bullet
  points. It’s crucial to include
  the marker block at the end as
  they specified to "display the
  markers exactly at the end."
  Inside the marker block, I’ll
  include the full QA report
  body.

  Here’s a summary of what I’ll
  cover: the AC check,
  validate:data output, npm test
  summary, and notes about the
  deprecated link hub. I won’t
  run npm run dev since it takes
  too long.

• I need to read the QA file and the ticket
  to verify the changes. First, I’ll ensure
  the first line indicates OK or FAIL, and
  if possible, I’ll run the tests including
  the exact markers at the end. I plan to
  execute shell commands to read the inbox
  file, the ticket, and the referenced
  documents, maybe running npm test as
  well. This request seems similar to prior
  ones but could involve a different
  ticket. I'll use a parallel approach.

• I need to check the request file and
  validate the development changes against
  the ticket. It feels similar to previous
  tasks, so I think I’ll stick with the
  same approach. My plan is to use the
  shell to read the file and the ticket,
  alongside the relevant files. After that,
  I’ll run npm test and output either OK or
  FAIL, along with some markers for
  clarity. Let’s get started!

• I need to check the acceptance criteria
  (ACs) based on the user's request. It’s
  important to confirm that the Single
  Source of Truth (SSoT) exists. I’ll
  reference T7 and other terminologies,
  particularly focusing on any deprecated
  links and the RESEARCH-1 output. I’ve
  noticed a conflict regarding the APPROVE
  token based on previous instances. The
  RESEARCH-1 ticket includes SSoT and a
  deprecated link hub, while RESEARCH-1A
  ticket describes the ACs adequately.
  Finally, I’ll mention that tests pass,
  but npm run dev hasn’t been tested yet.

• I need to read the file and validate the
  Dev changes. The first line should start
  with either OK or FAIL, and I must
  include a marker block at the end with
  the exact markers. I’ll follow the
  previous format. I’ll check the QA
  request file and run tests if possible;
  the command I’ll need is npm test. It's
  crucial to use shell commands to view the
  file, the relevant ticket, and documents,
  and then run npm test. Let's get started!

• I need to determine if we pass or fail
  based on the acceptance criteria in the
  ticket. It includes both "npm test" and
  "npm run build," but our instructions
  only mention running "npm test." If the
  ticket requires a build and we didn't run
  it, should we mention that? Guidelines
  suggest if tests were left out or not
  proposed by the dev, it could be a fail,
  but that's not the case here. If the
  ticket requires it, we should run "npm
  run build."

  Completing the build process

  I should run npm run build in the
  curriculum-viewer for completeness. It’s
  important to ensure everything is
  properly set up and functioning. So, I'll
  go ahead and execute that shell command
  now. This step should help confirm that
  everything is in order before we proceed.
  Let's make sure we cover all bases to
  avoid any problems later on!

• All criteria are met, so I'm ready to
  prepare my output report. I need to start
  with an OK or FAIL status. Then, I'll
  include a short report with exact markers
  and note that tests and builds pass. I'll
  mention running commands like npm test
  and npm run build, but also keep in mind
  that npm run dev wasn't run. It’s good to
  note that the ticket doesn’t require
  APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES since the
  description changed. Let’s craft this!

• I need to read the file and

• This request seems similar to a
  previous RESEARCH-1A inventory
  document task. I need to verify
  the file exists and confirm
  that we've previously run
  validate:data and npm test. It
  might be necessary to run tests
  again and include the results.
  I'll consider running multiple
  tool calls to check the
  relevant documents while
  ensuring the acceptance
  criteria are met. I need to
  summarize any logs and warn
  about deprecated data
  contracts. If it all checks
  out, I’ll output an OK. Let's

• I’m noticing the document has 8
  open questions, and while the
  header suggests a minimum of 5,
  it seems like we’re meeting the
  requirement nicely. The QA
  request is asking for an ok/
  fail status on Dev changes, and
  I need to confirm the mapping
  table inside the contract
  document.

  We ran our tests, validate:data
  and npm test, both passing. I
  need to ensure the final output
  starts with OK or FAIL, and
  include the specific markers,
  ensuring no extra ones creep
  in.

  Crafting QA Response

  I need to ensure the first line
  in my message starts with OK or
  FAIL, so I’m planning to start
  with OK. I’ll then format the
  content as concise bullet
  points. It’s crucial to include
  the marker block at the end as
  they specified to "display the
  markers exactly at the end."
  Inside the marker block, I’ll
  include the full QA report
  body.

  Here’s a summary of what I’ll
  cover: the AC check,
  validate:data output, npm test
  summary, and notes about the
  deprecated link hub. I won’t
  run npm run dev since it takes
  too long.

• I need to read the file and
  verify any development changes.
  The first step is to output
  "OK" or "FAIL" on the first
  line, making sure to include a
  marker at the end exactly as
  required. I’ll follow the same
  approach from previous tasks,
  opening the file, gathering the
  necessary evidence from the
  referenced ticket, and running
  test commands if possible. It
  seems like another request
  following a similar pattern.
  I'll be using tools for this.

• I'm thinking about not running
  the development due to the
  potential long run. I should
  gather evidence for mapping and
  also make note of warnings from
  the tests regarding the act and
  router for future reference.
  It’s important to mention these
  issues as non-failing ones,
  too. Additionally, I want to
  make sure there’s a marker at
  the end with the report body
  included. This will help keep
  everything organized and clear!

• I need to check the request file and
  validate the development changes against
  the ticket. It feels similar to previous
  tasks, so I think I’ll stick with the
  same approach. My plan is to use the
  shell to read the file and the ticket,
  alongside the relevant files. After that,
  I’ll run npm test and output either OK or
  FAIL, along with some markers for
  clarity. Let’s get started!

• I need to check the acceptance criteria
  (ACs) based on the user's request. It’s
  important to confirm that the Single
  Source of Truth (SSoT) exists. I’ll
  reference T7 and other terminologies,
  particularly focusing on any deprecated
  links and the RESEARCH-1 output. I’ve
  noticed a conflict regarding the APPROVE
  token based on previous instances. The
  RESEARCH-1 ticket includes SSoT and a
  deprecated link hub, while RESEARCH-1A
  ticket describes the ACs adequately.
  Finally, I’ll mention that tests pass,
  but npm run dev hasn’t been tested yet.

  Dev changes. The first line should start
  with either OK or FAIL, and I must
  include a marker block at the end with
  the exact markers. I’ll follow the
  previous format. I’ll check the QA
  request file and run tests if possible;
  the command I’ll need is npm test. It's

  and then run npm test. Let's get started!

• I need to determine if we pass or fail
  based on the acceptance criteria in the
  ticket. It includes both "npm test" and
  "npm run build," but our instructions
  only mention running "npm test." If the
  ticket requires a build and we didn't run
  it, should we mention that? Guidelines
  suggest if tests were left out or not
  proposed by the dev, it could be a fail,
  but that's not the case here. If the
  ticket requires it, we should run "npm
  run build."

  Completing the build process

  I should run npm run build in the
  curriculum-viewer for completeness. It’s
  important to ensure everything is
  properly set up and functioning. So, I'll
  go ahead and execute that shell command
  now. This step should help confirm that
  everything is in order before we proceed.
  Let's make sure we cover all bases to
  avoid any problems later on!

• All criteria are met, so I'm ready to
  prepare my output report. I need to start
  with an OK or FAIL status. Then, I'll
  include a short report with exact markers
  and note that tests and builds pass. I'll
  mention running commands like npm test
  and npm run build, but also keep in mind
  that npm run dev wasn't run. It’s good to
  note that the ticket doesn’t require
  APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES since the
  description changed. Let’s craft this!

• I need to read the file and

  previous RESEARCH-1A inventory
  document task. I need to verify
  the file exists and confirm
  that we've previously run
  validate:data and npm test. It
  might be necessary to run tests
  again and include the results.
  I'll consider running multiple
  tool calls to check the
  relevant documents while
  ensuring the acceptance
  criteria are met. I need to
  summarize any logs and warn
  about deprecated data
  contracts. If it all checks
  out, I’ll output an OK. Let's

• I’m noticing the document has 8
  open questions, and while the
  header suggests a minimum of 5,
  it seems like we’re meeting the
  requirement nicely. The QA
  request is asking for an ok/
  fail status on Dev changes, and
  I need to confirm the mapping
  table inside the contract
  document.

  We ran our tests, validate:data
  and npm test, both passing. I
  need to ensure the final output
  starts with OK or FAIL, and
  include the specific markers,
  ensuring no extra ones creep
  in.

  Crafting QA Response

  I need to ensure the first line
  in my message starts with OK or
  FAIL, so I’m planning to start
  with OK. I’ll then format the
  content as concise bullet
  points. It’s crucial to include
  the marker block at the end as
  they specified to "display the
  markers exactly at the end."
  Inside the marker block, I’ll
  include the full QA report
  body.

  Here’s a summary of what I’ll
  cover: the AC check,
  validate:data output, npm test
  summary, and notes about the
  deprecated link hub. I won’t
  run npm run dev since it takes
  too long.

• I need to read the file and
  verify any development changes.
  The first step is to output
  "OK" or "FAIL" on the first
  line, making sure to include a
  marker at the end exactly as
  required. I’ll follow the same
  approach from previous tasks,
  opening the file, gathering the
  necessary evidence from the
  referenced ticket, and running
  test commands if possible. It
  seems like another request
  following a similar pattern.
  I'll be using tools for this.

• I'm thinking about not running
  the development due to the
  potential long run. I should
  gather evidence for mapping and
  also make note of warnings from
  the tests regarding the act and
  router for future reference.
  It’s important to mention these
  issues as non-failing ones,
  too. Additionally, I want to
  make sure there’s a marker at
  the end with the report body
  included. This will help keep
  everything organized and clear!

• I need to check the request file and
  validate the development changes against
  the ticket. It feels similar to previous
  tasks, so I think I’ll stick with the
  same approach. My plan is to use the
  shell to read the file and the ticket,
  alongside the relevant files. After that,
  I’ll run npm test and output either OK or
  FAIL, along with some markers for
  clarity. Let’s get started!

• I need to check the acceptance criteria
  (ACs) based on the user's request. It’s
  important to confirm that the Single
  Source of Truth (SSoT) exists. I’ll
  reference T7 and other terminologies,
  particularly focusing on any deprecated
  links and the RESEARCH-1 output. I’ve
  noticed a conflict regarding the APPROVE
  token based on previous instances. The
  RESEARCH-1 ticket includes SSoT and a
  deprecated link hub, while RESEARCH-1A
  ticket describes the ACs adequately.
  Finally, I’ll mention that tests pass,
  but npm run dev hasn’t been tested yet.

• I need to determine if we pass or fail
  based on the acceptance criteria in the
  ticket. It includes both "npm test" and
  "npm run build," but our instructions
  only mention running "npm test." If the
  ticket requires a build and we didn't run
  it, should we mention that? Guidelines
  suggest if tests were left out or not
  proposed by the dev, it could be a fail,
  but that's not the case here. If the
  ticket requires it, we should run "npm
  run build."

  Completing the build process

  I should run npm run build in the
  curriculum-viewer for completeness. It’s
  important to ensure everything is
  properly set up and functioning. So, I'll
  go ahead and execute that shell command
  now. This step should help confirm that
  everything is in order before we proceed.
  Let's make sure we cover all bases to
  avoid any problems later on!

  include a short report with exact markers
  and note that tests and builds pass. I'll
  mention running commands like npm test
  and npm run build, but also keep in mind
  that npm run dev wasn't run. It’s good to
  note that the ticket doesn’t require
  APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES since the

• I’m noticing the document has 8
  open questions, and while the
  header suggests a minimum of 5,
  it seems like we’re meeting the
  requirement nicely. The QA
  request is asking for an ok/
  fail status on Dev changes, and
  I need to confirm the mapping
  table inside the contract
  document.

  We ran our tests, validate:data
  and npm test, both passing. I
  need to ensure the final output
  starts with OK or FAIL, and
  include the specific markers,
  ensuring no extra ones creep
  in.

  Crafting QA Response

  I need to ensure the first line
  in my message starts with OK or
  FAIL, so I’m planning to start
  with OK. I’ll then format the
  content as concise bullet
  points. It’s crucial to include
  the marker block at the end as
  they specified to "display the
  markers exactly at the end."
  Inside the marker block, I’ll
  include the full QA report
  body.

  Here’s a summary of what I’ll
  cover: the AC check,
  validate:data output, npm test
  summary, and notes about the
  deprecated link hub. I won’t
  run npm run dev since it takes
  too long.

• I need to read the file and
  verify any development changes.
  The first step is to output
  "OK" or "FAIL" on the first
  line, making sure to include a
  marker at the end exactly as
  required. I’ll follow the same
  approach from previous tasks,
  opening the file, gathering the
  necessary evidence from the
  referenced ticket, and running
  test commands if possible. It
  seems like another request
  following a similar pattern.
  I'll be using tools for this.

• I'm thinking about not running
  the development due to the
  potential long run. I should
  gather evidence for mapping and
  also make note of warnings from
  the tests regarding the act and
  router for future reference.
  It’s important to mention these
  issues as non-failing ones,
  too. Additionally, I want to
  make sure there’s a marker at
  the end with the report body
  included. This will help keep
  everything organized and clear!

  Dev changes. The first line should start
  with either OK or FAIL, and I must
  include a marker block at the end with
  the exact markers. I’ll follow the
  previous format. I’ll check the QA
  request file and run tests if possible;
  the command I’ll need is npm test. It's
  crucial to use shell commands to view the
  file, the relevant ticket, and documents,
  and then run npm test. Let's get started!

• I need to determine if we pass or fail
  based on the acceptance criteria in the
  ticket. It includes both "npm test" and
  "npm run build," but our instructions
  only mention running "npm test." If the
  ticket requires a build and we didn't run
  it, should we mention that? Guidelines
  suggest if tests were left out or not
  proposed by the dev, it could be a fail,
  but that's not the case here. If the
  ticket requires it, we should run "npm
  run build."

  Completing the build process

  I should run npm run build in the
  curriculum-viewer for completeness. It’s
  important to ensure everything is
  properly set up and functioning. So, I'll
  go ahead and execute that shell command
  now. This step should help confirm that
  everything is in order before we proceed.
  Let's make sure we cover all bases to
  avoid any problems later on!

• All criteria are met, so I'm ready to
  prepare my output report. I need to start
  with an OK or FAIL status. Then, I'll
  include a short report with exact markers
  and note that tests and builds pass. I'll
  mention running commands like npm test
  and npm run build, but also keep in mind
  that npm run dev wasn't run. It’s good to
  note that the ticket doesn’t require
  APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES since the
  description changed. Let’s craft this!

• I need to read the file and

  It’s going to be similar to

  document task. I need to verify
  the file exists and confirm
  that we've previously run
  validate:data and npm test. It
  might be necessary to run tests
  again and include the results.
  I'll consider running multiple
  tool calls to check the
  relevant documents while
  ensuring the acceptance
  criteria are met. I need to
  summarize any logs and warn
  about deprecated data
  contracts. If it all checks
  out, I’ll output an OK. Let's

• I’m noticing the document has 8
  open questions, and while the
  header suggests a minimum of 5,
  it seems like we’re meeting the
  requirement nicely. The QA
  request is asking for an ok/
  fail status on Dev changes, and
  I need to confirm the mapping
  table inside the contract
  document.

  We ran our tests, validate:data
  and npm test, both passing. I
  need to ensure the final output
  starts with OK or FAIL, and
  include the specific markers,
  ensuring no extra ones creep
  in.

  Crafting QA Response

  I need to ensure the first line
  in my message starts with OK or
  FAIL, so I’m planning to start
  with OK. I’ll then format the
  content as concise bullet
  points. It’s crucial to include
  the marker block at the end as
  they specified to "display the
  markers exactly at the end."
  Inside the marker block, I’ll
  include the full QA report
  body.

  Here’s a summary of what I’ll
  cover: the AC check,
  validate:data output, npm test
  summary, and notes about the
  deprecated link hub. I won’t
  run npm run dev since it takes
  too long.

• I need to read the file and
  verify any development changes.
  The first step is to output
  "OK" or "FAIL" on the first
  line, making sure to include a
  marker at the end exactly as
  required. I’ll follow the same
  approach from previous tasks,
  opening the file, gathering the
  necessary evidence from the
  referenced ticket, and running
  test commands if possible. It
  seems like another request
  following a similar pattern.
  I'll be using tools for this.

• I'm thinking about not running
  the development due to the
  potential long run. I should
  gather evidence for mapping and
  also make note of warnings from
  the tests regarding the act and
  router for future reference.
  It’s important to mention these
  issues as non-failing ones,
  too. Additionally, I want to
  make sure there’s a marker at
  the end with the report body
  included. This will help keep
  everything organized and clear!

  development. It's also important to
  mention the RESEARCH-1A1 ticket regarding
  the changed format constraints. The
  request expects an OK or FAIL in the
  first line, so I'll ensure to provide
  that. I need to include exact markers at
  the end with no extra text after, and
  I'll use short bullet points for clarity.

  that we've previously run
  validate:data and npm test. It
  might be necessary to run tests
  again and include the results.
  I'll consider running multiple
  tool calls to check the
  relevant documents while
  ensuring the acceptance
  criteria are met. I need to
  summarize any logs and warn
  about deprecated data
  contracts. If it all checks
  out, I’ll output an OK. Let's

• I’m noticing the document has 8
  open questions, and while the
  header suggests a minimum of 5,
  it seems like we’re meeting the
  requirement nicely. The QA
  request is asking for an ok/
  fail status on Dev changes, and
  I need to confirm the mapping
  table inside the contract
  document.

  We ran our tests, validate:data
  and npm test, both passing. I
  need to ensure the final output
  starts with OK or FAIL, and
  include the specific markers,
  ensuring no extra ones creep
  in.

  Crafting QA Response

  I need to ensure the first line
  in my message starts with OK or
  FAIL, so I’m planning to start
  with OK. I’ll then format the
  content as concise bullet
  points. It’s crucial to include
  the marker block at the end as
  they specified to "display the
  markers exactly at the end."
  Inside the marker block, I’ll
  include the full QA report
  body.

  Here’s a summary of what I’ll
  cover: the AC check,
  validate:data output, npm test
  summary, and notes about the
  deprecated link hub. I won’t
  run npm run dev since it takes
  too long.

• I need to read the file and
  verify any development changes.
  The first step is to output
  "OK" or "FAIL" on the first
  line, making sure to include a
  marker at the end exactly as
  required. I’ll follow the same
  approach from previous tasks,
  opening the file, gathering the
  necessary evidence from the
  referenced ticket, and running
  test commands if possible. It
  seems like another request
  following a similar pattern.
  I'll be using tools for this.

• I'm thinking about not running
  the development due to the
  potential long run. I should
  gather evidence for mapping and
  also make note of warnings from
  the tests regarding the act and
  router for future reference.
  It’s important to mention these
  issues as non-failing ones,
  too. Additionally, I want to
  make sure there’s a marker at
  the end with the report body

• I need to look at the RESEARCH-
  2 ticket to confirm the content
  and validate the data. There
  won't be any changes, but I
  must confirm the acceptance
  criteria. I’m planning to open
  the ticket and reference
  related documents, likely
  regarding the math curriculum
  sample data. I’ll run the npm
  run validate:data command in
  the curriculum-viewer, although
  I’m considering whether to run
  other commands too. The dev
  suggested npm run dev, but I’ll
  avoid that for now since it’s
  interactive and requires a
  browser. I’ll inspect the data
  file for the path and metadata.

• Explored
  └ Read RESEARCH-2.md

• I need to confirm the data
  using the validate:data
  function. I should also check
  that the JSON structure follows
  the path
  subject->grade->domain->standar
  d and that the domain meets
  progression edge conditions. It
  seems like validate:data should
  cover these checks, but for
  AC1, I can quickly parse the
  JSON to verify. I wonder if
  validate:data explicitly checks
  AC1, though. I guess I’ll run
  it anyway and also check the
  meta fields. Locating the
  scripts in the curriculum-
  viewer for validate:data isn’t
  necessary right now, but I'll
  proceed with running the
  command.

• Ran cd curriculum-viewer && npm
  │ run validate:data
  └

• I noticed there's an issue with
  the sample full path not
  matching the expected JSON
  structure; it might be about
  normalized arrays with nodes.
  It seems like my initial
  assumption was off since the
  validate-data says it's valid.
  I think I need to take a closer
  look at the structure, so I'll
  print out the top-level keys
  using Python to better
  understand what's going on.
  Let's figure this out!

• Ran python - <<'PY'

    'nodes'])
    … +7 lines
    'title', 'subject',
    'children_ids', 'source'])

• I'm focusing on a nodes-based
  graph and need to ensure that
  the full path from subject to
  grade to domain to standard
  exists. I think I need to check
  the node types and their
  children to build a traversal
  method. I'll look for at least
  one subject node with a
  corresponding child grade node.
  I should also check if the
  domain_code and grade appear in
  the nodes' meta. To clarify the
  node shape, I’ll open the
  specified contract file.

• I'm thinking about writing a
  script to parse nodes and group
  the domain codes to their
  respective grades. I want to
  check if any of them have at
  least two adjacent grades. I'll
  also need to verify the full
  path. This means finding a
  subject node that connects to a
  grade child, then a domain
  child, and finally a standard
  child while ensuring the type
  checks out. Plus, I can rely on
  a validation script to check
  the hierarchy, though it might
  not verify the existence of a
  full path, but that seems
  implied.

[2026-01-14 16:21:18] QA (req_id: 4d74fcf055)
============================================================

• I need to craft the report and include a
  marker. I've already run tests and built
  it, but I should note that I didn't run
  development. It's also important to
  mention the RESEARCH-1A1 ticket regarding
  the changed format constraints. The
  request expects an OK or FAIL in the
  first line, so I'll ensure to provide
  that. I need to include exact markers at
  the end with no extra text after, and
  I'll use short bullet points for clarity.
  Let's move forward!

• I need to read the file and
  create a QA report with the
  first line indicating OK or
  FAIL, and markers at the end.
  It’s going to be similar to
  what we’ve done before. I’ll
  use the shell command to view
  the file and check the relevant
  tickets, verifying documents
  while running tests and builds
  as specified. I think it’s
  important to parallelize the
  commands to optimize the
  process. Let's get started!

• This request seems similar to a
  previous RESEARCH-1A inventory
  document task. I need to verify
  the file exists and confirm
  that we've previously run
  validate:data and npm test. It
  might be necessary to run tests
  again and include the results.
  I'll consider running multiple
  tool calls to check the
  relevant documents while
  ensuring the acceptance
  criteria are met. I need to
  summarize any logs and warn
  about deprecated data
  contracts. If it all checks
  out, I’ll output an OK. Let's
  begin!

• I’m noticing the document has 8
  open questions, and while the
  header suggests a minimum of 5,
  it seems like we’re meeting the
  requirement nicely. The QA
  request is asking for an ok/
  fail status on Dev changes, and
  I need to confirm the mapping
  table inside the contract
  document.

  We ran our tests, validate:data
  and npm test, both passing. I
  need to ensure the final output
  starts with OK or FAIL, and
  include the specific markers,
  ensuring no extra ones creep
  in.

  Crafting QA Response

  I need to ensure the first line
  in my message starts with OK or
  FAIL, so I’m planning to start
  with OK. I’ll then format the
  content as concise bullet
  points. It’s crucial to include
  the marker block at the end as
  they specified to "display the
  markers exactly at the end."
  Inside the marker block, I’ll
  include the full QA report
  body.

  Here’s a summary of what I’ll
  cover: the AC check,
  validate:data output, npm test
  summary, and notes about the
  deprecated link hub. I won’t
  run npm run dev since it takes
  too long.

• I need to read the file and
  verify any development changes.
  The first step is to output
  "OK" or "FAIL" on the first
  line, making sure to include a
  marker at the end exactly as
  required. I’ll follow the same
  approach from previous tasks,
  opening the file, gathering the
  necessary evidence from the
  referenced ticket, and running
  test commands if possible. It
  seems like another request
  following a similar pattern.
  I'll be using tools for this.

• I'm thinking about not running
  the development due to the
  potential long run. I should
  gather evidence for mapping and
  also make note of warnings from
  the tests regarding the act and
  router for future reference.
  It’s important to mention these
  issues as non-failing ones,
  too. Additionally, I want to
  make sure there’s a marker at
  the end with the report body
  included. This will help keep
  everything organized and clear!

• I need to read the file and

  changes, outputting OK or FAIL
  on the first line. Including
  test results would be ideal if
  possible. I must print the
  markers at the end exactly as
  specified. I'll follow the
  established patterns and
  potentially run some commands.
  First, I'll check the QA
  request file, ticket, and
  referenced documents before
  running the specified tests.
  Alright, I'm ready to proceed

• I'm looking at the task similar
  to RESEARCH-1B, which is likely
  okay, but I need to double-
  check everything. I’ll go
  through the ticket, the
  contract, and data-contract.md
  to make sure I'm on the right
  track. Then, I'll run
  validate:data and npm test to
  confirm everything is
  functioning as expected. It

• I need to look at the RESEARCH-
  2 ticket to confirm the content
  and validate the data. There
  won't be any changes, but I
  must confirm the acceptance
  criteria. I’m planning to open
  the ticket and reference
  related documents, likely
  regarding the math curriculum
  sample data. I’ll run the npm
  run validate:data command in
  the curriculum-viewer, although
  I’m considering whether to run
  other commands too. The dev
  suggested npm run dev, but I’ll
  avoid that for now since it’s
  interactive and requires a
  browser. I’ll inspect the data
  file for the path and metadata.

• Explored
  └ Read RESEARCH-2.md

• I need to confirm the data
  using the validate:data
  function. I should also check
  that the JSON structure follows
  the path
  subject->grade->domain->standar
  d and that the domain meets
  progression edge conditions. It
  seems like validate:data should
  cover these checks, but for
  AC1, I can quickly parse the
  JSON to verify. I wonder if
  validate:data explicitly checks
  AC1, though. I guess I’ll run
  it anyway and also check the
  meta fields. Locating the
  scripts in the curriculum-
  viewer for validate:data isn’t
  necessary right now, but I'll
  proceed with running the
  command.

• I noticed there's an issue with
  the sample full path not
  matching the expected JSON
  structure; it might be about
  normalized arrays with nodes.
  It seems like my initial
  assumption was off since the
  validate-data says it's valid.
  I think I need to take a closer
  look at the structure, so I'll
  print out the top-level keys
  using Python to better
  understand what's going on.
  Let's figure this out!

    'nodes'])

    'title', 'subject',
    'children_ids', 'source'])

• I'm focusing on a nodes-based
  graph and need to ensure that
  the full path from subject to
  grade to domain to standard
  exists. I think I need to check
  the node types and their
  children to build a traversal
  method. I'll look for at least
  one subject node with a
  corresponding child grade node.
  I should also check if the
  domain_code and grade appear in
  the nodes' meta. To clarify the
  node shape, I’ll open the
  specified contract file.

• I'm thinking about writing a
  script to parse nodes and group
  the domain codes to their
  respective grades. I want to
  check if any of them have at
  least two adjacent grades. I'll
  also need to verify the full
  path. This means finding a
  subject node that connects to a
  grade child, then a domain
  child, and finally a standard
  child while ensuring the type
  checks out. Plus, I can rely on
  a validation script to check
  the hierarchy, though it might
  not verify the existence of a
  full path, but that seems
  implied.

• I need to read a file and
  validate the changes made in
  development. I should perform
  some tool calls like using
  'sed' to access the QA file,
  and then read the ticket and
  referenced files. After that,
  running test commands seems
  necessary. I'm wondering if I
  should use a plan for this, but
  maybe I can just take a
  straightforward approach with a
  single request. For now, I’ll
  focus on running 'sed' to read
  the QA file.

• Explored

• This request feels similar to
  the previous one; it's the same
  ticket and tests. We just
  validated the data for that
  earlier request. Still, the
  requirement mentions that it’s
  possible to run commands again,
  so why not rerun it? It's quick
  and should be straightforward.
  I'll make sure to confirm the
  AC path and any meta
  information too. So, let's
  proceed with the validate:data
  command once more.

• I should mention doing a prior
  check and confirm the sample
  path metadata and progression
  using Python. It seems running
  this check is optional, but I
  think it’s good to include an
  AC check in the report. It’s a
  good practice to run it quickly
  just to ensure everything is
  accurate. Keeping tabs on the
  details could save us some
  trouble later! So, I’ll move
  forward with that.

• I’m focused on creating a
  report, starting with a clear
  first line. I should include a
  summary of the command run and
  its output while noting that
  there are no changes to report.
  Additionally, the QA file
  references the same ticket, so
  I’ll mention that without
  needing to read it again. Once
  I’ve crafted everything, I need
  to ensure that the marker is
  precise at the very end,
  including the QA report inside
  it. Let's get started!

  it seems like we’re meeting the
  requirement nicely. The QA
  request is asking for an ok/
  fail status on Dev changes, and
  I need to confirm the mapping
  table inside the contract
  document.

  We ran our tests, validate:data
  and npm test, both passing. I
  need to ensure the final output
  starts with OK or FAIL, and
  include the specific markers,
  ensuring no extra ones creep
  in.

  Crafting QA Response

  I need to ensure the first line
  in my message starts with OK or
  FAIL, so I’m planning to start
  with OK. I’ll then format the
  content as concise bullet
  points. It’s crucial to include
  the marker block at the end as
  they specified to "display the
  markers exactly at the end."
  Inside the marker block, I’ll
  include the full QA report
  body.

  Here’s a summary of what I’ll
  cover: the AC check,
  validate:data output, npm test
  summary, and notes about the
  deprecated link hub. I won’t
  run npm run dev since it takes

• I need to read the file and
  verify any development changes.
  The first step is to output
  "OK" or "FAIL" on the first
  line, making sure to include a
  marker at the end exactly as
  required. I’ll follow the same
  approach from previous tasks,
  opening the file, gathering the
  necessary evidence from the
  referenced ticket, and running
  test commands if possible. It
  seems like another request
  following a similar pattern.
  I'll be using tools for this.

• I'm thinking about not running
  the development due to the
  potential long run. I should
  gather evidence for mapping and
  also make note of warnings from
  the tests regarding the act and
  router for future reference.
  It’s important to mention these
  issues as non-failing ones,
  too. Additionally, I want to
  make sure there’s a marker at
  the end with the report body
  included. This will help keep
  everything organized and clear!

• I need to look at the RESEARCH-
  2 ticket to confirm the content
  and validate the data. There
  won't be any changes, but I
  must confirm the acceptance
  criteria. I’m planning to open
  the ticket and reference
  related documents, likely
  regarding the math curriculum
  sample data. I’ll run the npm
  run validate:data command in
  the curriculum-viewer, although
  I’m considering whether to run
  other commands too. The dev
  suggested npm run dev, but I’ll
  avoid that for now since it’s
  interactive and requires a
  browser. I’ll inspect the data
  file for the path and metadata.

• Explored

• I need to confirm the data
  using the validate:data
  function. I should also check
  that the JSON structure follows
  the path
  subject->grade->domain->standar
  d and that the domain meets
  progression edge conditions. It
  seems like validate:data should
  cover these checks, but for
  AC1, I can quickly parse the
  JSON to verify. I wonder if
  validate:data explicitly checks
  AC1, though. I guess I’ll run
  it anyway and also check the
  meta fields. Locating the
  scripts in the curriculum-
  viewer for validate:data isn’t
  necessary right now, but I'll
  proceed with running the
  command.

• I noticed there's an issue with
  the sample full path not
  matching the expected JSON
  structure; it might be about
  normalized arrays with nodes.
  It seems like my initial
  assumption was off since the
  validate-data says it's valid.
  I think I need to take a closer
  look at the structure, so I'll
  print out the top-level keys
  using Python to better
  understand what's going on.
  Let's figure this out!

• I'm focusing on a nodes-based
  graph and need to ensure that
  the full path from subject to
  grade to domain to standard
  exists. I think I need to check
  the node types and their
  children to build a traversal
  method. I'll look for at least
  one subject node with a
  corresponding child grade node.
  I should also check if the
  domain_code and grade appear in
  the nodes' meta. To clarify the
  node shape, I’ll open the
  specified contract file.

  the domain codes to their

  check if any of them have at
  least two adjacent grades. I'll
  also need to verify the full
  path. This means finding a
  subject node that connects to a
  grade child, then a domain
  child, and finally a standard
  child while ensuring the type
  checks out. Plus, I can rely on
  a validation script to check
  the hierarchy, though it might
  not verify the existence of a
  full path, but that seems
  implied.

  the previous one; it's the same
  ticket and tests. We just
  validated the data for that
  earlier request. Still, the
  requirement mentions that it’s
  possible to run commands again,
  so why not rerun it? It's quick
  and should be straightforward.
  I'll make sure to confirm the
  AC path and any meta
  information too. So, let's
  proceed with the validate:data
  command once more.

• Ran cd curriculum-viewer && npm
  │ run validate:data
  └
    > curriculum-viewer@0.0.0
    … +4 lines
    OK: curriculum_math_v1.json
    is valid

• I should mention doing a prior
  check and confirm the sample
  path metadata and progression
  using Python. It seems running
  this check is optional, but I
  think it’s good to include an
  AC check in the report. It’s a
  good practice to run it quickly
  just to ensure everything is
  accurate. Keeping tabs on the
  details could save us some
  trouble later! So, I’ll move
  forward with that.

• Ran python - <<'PY'

    'MATH-2022-G-1',
    … +9 lines
    'ko-KR', 'generated_at':
    '2025-12-30'}

• I’m focused on creating a
  report, starting with a clear
  first line. I should include a
  summary of the command run and
  its output while noting that
  there are no changes to report.
  Additionally, the QA file
  references the same ticket, so
  I’ll mention that without
  needing to read it again. Once
  I’ve crafted everything, I need
  to ensure that the marker is
  precise at the very end,
  including the QA report inside
  it. Let's get started!

• I’m noticing the document has 8
  open questions, and while the
  header suggests a minimum of 5,
  it seems like we’re meeting the
  requirement nicely. The QA
  request is asking for an ok/
  fail status on Dev changes, and
  I need to confirm the mapping
  table inside the contract
  document.

  We ran our tests, validate:data
  and npm test, both passing. I
  need to ensure the final output
  starts with OK or FAIL, and
  include the specific markers,
  ensuring no extra ones creep
  in.

  Crafting QA Response

  I need to ensure the first line
  in my message starts with OK or
  FAIL, so I’m planning to start
  with OK. I’ll then format the
  content as concise bullet
  points. It’s crucial to include
  the marker block at the end as
  they specified to "display the
  markers exactly at the end."
  Inside the marker block, I’ll
  include the full QA report
  body.

  Here’s a summary of what I’ll
  cover: the AC check,
  validate:data output, npm test
  summary, and notes about the
  deprecated link hub. I won’t
  run npm run dev since it takes
  too long.

• I need to read the file and
  verify any development changes.
  The first step is to output
  "OK" or "FAIL" on the first
  line, making sure to include a
  marker at the end exactly as
  required. I’ll follow the same
  approach from previous tasks,
  opening the file, gathering the
  necessary evidence from the
  referenced ticket, and running
  test commands if possible. It
  seems like another request
  following a similar pattern.
  I'll be using tools for this.

• I'm thinking about not running
  the development due to the
  potential long run. I should
  gather evidence for mapping and
  also make note of warnings from
  the tests regarding the act and
  router for future reference.
  It’s important to mention these
  issues as non-failing ones,
  too. Additionally, I want to
  make sure there’s a marker at
  the end with the report body
  included. This will help keep
  everything organized and clear!

  changes, outputting OK or FAIL
  on the first line. Including
  test results would be ideal if
  possible. I must print the
  markers at the end exactly as
  specified. I'll follow the
  established patterns and
  potentially run some commands.

  running the specified tests.
  Alright, I'm ready to proceed

• I'm looking at the task similar
  to RESEARCH-1B, which is likely
  okay, but I need to double-
  check everything. I’ll go
  through the ticket, the
  contract, and data-contract.md
  to make sure I'm on the right
  track. Then, I'll run
  validate:data and npm test to
  confirm everything is
  functioning as expected. It

• I need to look at the RESEARCH-
  2 ticket to confirm the content
  and validate the data. There
  won't be any changes, but I
  must confirm the acceptance
  criteria. I’m planning to open
  the ticket and reference
  related documents, likely
  regarding the math curriculum
  sample data. I’ll run the npm
  run validate:data command in
  the curriculum-viewer, although
  I’m considering whether to run
  other commands too. The dev
  suggested npm run dev, but I’ll
  avoid that for now since it’s
  interactive and requires a
  browser. I’ll inspect the data
  file for the path and metadata.

• Explored
  └ Read RESEARCH-2.md

• I need to confirm the data
  using the validate:data
  function. I should also check
  that the JSON structure follows
  the path
  subject->grade->domain->standar
  d and that the domain meets
  progression edge conditions. It
  seems like validate:data should
  cover these checks, but for
  AC1, I can quickly parse the
  JSON to verify. I wonder if
  validate:data explicitly checks
  AC1, though. I guess I’ll run
  it anyway and also check the
  meta fields. Locating the
  scripts in the curriculum-
  viewer for validate:data isn’t
  necessary right now, but I'll
  proceed with running the
  command.

• I noticed there's an issue with
  the sample full path not
  matching the expected JSON
  structure; it might be about
  normalized arrays with nodes.
  It seems like my initial
  assumption was off since the
  validate-data says it's valid.
  I think I need to take a closer
  look at the structure, so I'll
  print out the top-level keys
  using Python to better
  understand what's going on.
  Let's figure this out!

    'children_ids', 'source'])

• I'm focusing on a nodes-based
  graph and need to ensure that
  the full path from subject to
  grade to domain to standard
  exists. I think I need to check
  the node types and their
  children to build a traversal
  method. I'll look for at least
  one subject node with a
  corresponding child grade node.
  I should also check if the
  domain_code and grade appear in
  the nodes' meta. To clarify the
  node shape, I’ll open the
  specified contract file.

• I'm thinking about writing a
  script to parse nodes and group
  the domain codes to their
  respective grades. I want to
  check if any of them have at
  least two adjacent grades. I'll
  also need to verify the full
  path. This means finding a
  subject node that connects to a
  grade child, then a domain
  child, and finally a standard
  child while ensuring the type
  checks out. Plus, I can rely on
  a validation script to check
  the hierarchy, though it might
  not verify the existence of a
  full path, but that seems
  implied.

• I need to read a file and
  validate the changes made in
  development. I should perform
  some tool calls like using
  'sed' to access the QA file,
  and then read the ticket and
  referenced files. After that,
  running test commands seems
  necessary. I'm wondering if I
  should use a plan for this, but
  maybe I can just take a
  straightforward approach with a
  single request. For now, I’ll
  focus on running 'sed' to read
  the QA file.

• Explored
  └ Read qa_4d74fcf055.md

• This request feels similar to
  the previous one; it's the same
  ticket and tests. We just
  validated the data for that
  earlier request. Still, the
  requirement mentions that it’s
  possible to run commands again,
  so why not rerun it? It's quick
  and should be straightforward.
  I'll make sure to confirm the
  AC path and any meta
  information too. So, let's
  proceed with the validate:data
  command once more.

• Ran cd curriculum-viewer && npm
  │ run validate:data
  └
    > curriculum-viewer@0.0.0
    … +4 lines
    OK: curriculum_math_v1.json

• I should mention doing a prior
  check and confirm the sample
  path metadata and progression
  using Python. It seems running
  this check is optional, but I
  think it’s good to include an
  AC check in the report. It’s a
  good practice to run it quickly
  just to ensure everything is
  accurate. Keeping tabs on the
  details could save us some
  trouble later! So, I’ll move
  forward with that.

• Ran python - <<'PY'

• I’m focused on creating a
  report, starting with a clear
  first line. I should include a
  summary of the command run and
  its output while noting that
  there are no changes to report.
  Additionally, the QA file
  references the same ticket, so
  I’ll mention that without
  needing to read it again. Once
  I’ve crafted everything, I need
  to ensure that the marker is
  precise at the very end,
  including the QA report inside
  it. Let's get started!

        본 QA에서는 미실행.

• I’m noticing the document has 8
  open questions, and while the
  header suggests a minimum of 5,
  it seems like we’re meeting the
  requirement nicely. The QA
  request is asking for an ok/
  fail status on Dev changes, and
  I need to confirm the mapping
  table inside the contract
  document.

  We ran our tests, validate:data
  and npm test, both passing. I
  need to ensure the final output
  starts with OK or FAIL, and
  include the specific markers,
  ensuring no extra ones creep
  in.

  Crafting QA Response

  I need to ensure the first line
  in my message starts with OK or
  FAIL, so I’m planning to start
  with OK. I’ll then format the
  content as concise bullet
  points. It’s crucial to include
  the marker block at the end as
  they specified to "display the
  markers exactly at the end."
  Inside the marker block, I’ll
  include the full QA report
  body.

  Here’s a summary of what I’ll
  cover: the AC check,
  validate:data output, npm test
  summary, and notes about the
  deprecated link hub. I won’t
  run npm run dev since it takes
  too long.

• I need to read the file and
  verify any development changes.
  The first step is to output
  "OK" or "FAIL" on the first
  line, making sure to include a
  marker at the end exactly as
  required. I’ll follow the same
  approach from previous tasks,
  opening the file, gathering the
  necessary evidence from the
  referenced ticket, and running
  test commands if possible. It
  seems like another request
  following a similar pattern.
  I'll be using tools for this.

• I'm thinking about not running
  the development due to the
  potential long run. I should
  gather evidence for mapping and
  also make note of warnings from
  the tests regarding the act and
  router for future reference.
  It’s important to mention these
  issues as non-failing ones,
  too. Additionally, I want to
  make sure there’s a marker at
  the end with the report body
  included. This will help keep
  everything organized and clear!

• I need to look at the RESEARCH-
  2 ticket to confirm the content
  and validate the data. There
  won't be any changes, but I
  must confirm the acceptance
  criteria. I’m planning to open
  the ticket and reference
  related documents, likely
  regarding the math curriculum
  sample data. I’ll run the npm
  run validate:data command in
  the curriculum-viewer, although
  I’m considering whether to run
  other commands too. The dev
  suggested npm run dev, but I’ll
  avoid that for now since it’s
  interactive and requires a
  browser. I’ll inspect the data
  file for the path and metadata.

• Explored
  └ Read RESEARCH-2.md

• I need to confirm the data
  using the validate:data
  function. I should also check
  that the JSON structure follows
  the path
  subject->grade->domain->standar
  d and that the domain meets
  progression edge conditions. It
  seems like validate:data should
  cover these checks, but for
  AC1, I can quickly parse the
  JSON to verify. I wonder if
  validate:data explicitly checks
  AC1, though. I guess I’ll run
  it anyway and also check the
  meta fields. Locating the
  scripts in the curriculum-
  viewer for validate:data isn’t
  necessary right now, but I'll
  proceed with running the
  command.

• Ran cd curriculum-viewer && npm
  │ run validate:data

• I noticed there's an issue with
  the sample full path not
  matching the expected JSON
  structure; it might be about
  normalized arrays with nodes.
  It seems like my initial
  assumption was off since the
  validate-data says it's valid.
  I think I need to take a closer
  look at the structure, so I'll
  print out the top-level keys
  using Python to better
  understand what's going on.
  Let's figure this out!

• Ran python - <<'PY'

    'nodes'])

    'title', 'subject',
    'children_ids', 'source'])

• I'm focusing on a nodes-based
  graph and need to ensure that
  the full path from subject to
  grade to domain to standard
  exists. I think I need to check
  the node types and their
  children to build a traversal
  method. I'll look for at least
  one subject node with a
  corresponding child grade node.
  I should also check if the
  domain_code and grade appear in
  the nodes' meta. To clarify the
  node shape, I’ll open the
  specified contract file.

• I'm thinking about writing a
  script to parse nodes and group
  the domain codes to their
  respective grades. I want to
  check if any of them have at
  least two adjacent grades. I'll
  also need to verify the full
  path. This means finding a
  subject node that connects to a
  grade child, then a domain
  child, and finally a standard
  child while ensuring the type
  checks out. Plus, I can rely on
  a validation script to check
  the hierarchy, though it might
  not verify the existence of a
  full path, but that seems
  implied.

• I need to read a file and
  validate the changes made in
  development. I should perform
  some tool calls like using
  'sed' to access the QA file,
  and then read the ticket and
  referenced files. After that,
  running test commands seems
  necessary. I'm wondering if I
  should use a plan for this, but
  maybe I can just take a
  straightforward approach with a
  single request. For now, I’ll
  focus on running 'sed' to read
  the QA file.

• Explored
  └ Read qa_4d74fcf055.md

• This request feels similar to
  the previous one; it's the same
  ticket and tests. We just
  validated the data for that
  earlier request. Still, the
  requirement mentions that it’s
  possible to run commands again,
  so why not rerun it? It's quick
  and should be straightforward.
  I'll make sure to confirm the
  AC path and any meta
  information too. So, let's
  proceed with the validate:data
  command once more.

• Ran cd curriculum-viewer && npm
  │ run validate:data
  └
    > curriculum-viewer@0.0.0
    … +4 lines
    OK: curriculum_math_v1.json
    is valid

• I should mention doing a prior
  check and confirm the sample
  path metadata and progression
  using Python. It seems running
  this check is optional, but I
  think it’s good to include an
  AC check in the report. It’s a
  good practice to run it quickly
  just to ensure everything is
  accurate. Keeping tabs on the
  details could save us some
  trouble later! So, I’ll move
  forward with that.

• Ran python - <<'PY'
  │ import json
  │ from collections import
  │ … +72 lines
  └ full_path ('MATH-2022',
    'MATH-2022-G-1',
    … +9 lines
    'ko-KR', 'generated_at':
    '2025-12-30'}

• I’m focused on creating a
  report, starting with a clear
  first line. I should include a
  summary of the command run and
  its output while noting that
  there are no changes to report.
  Additionally, the QA file
  references the same ticket, so
  I’ll mention that without
  needing to read it again. Once
  I’ve crafted everything, I need
  to ensure that the marker is
  precise at the very end,
  including the QA report inside
  it. Let's get started!

  crucial. I’m considering using

• I need to read the file and
  verify any development changes.
  The first step is to output
  "OK" or "FAIL" on the first
  line, making sure to include a
  marker at the end exactly as
  required. I’ll follow the same
  approach from previous tasks,
  opening the file, gathering the
  necessary evidence from the
  referenced ticket, and running
  test commands if possible. It
  seems like another request
  following a similar pattern.
  I'll be using tools for this.

• I'm thinking about not running
  the development due to the
  potential long run. I should
  gather evidence for mapping and
  also make note of warnings from
  the tests regarding the act and
  router for future reference.
  It’s important to mention these
  issues as non-failing ones,
  too. Additionally, I want to
  make sure there’s a marker at
  the end with the report body
  included. This will help keep
  everything organized and clear!

• I need to look at the RESEARCH-
  2 ticket to confirm the content
  and validate the data. There
  won't be any changes, but I
  must confirm the acceptance
  criteria. I’m planning to open
  the ticket and reference
  related documents, likely
  regarding the math curriculum
  sample data. I’ll run the npm
  run validate:data command in
  the curriculum-viewer, although
  I’m considering whether to run
  other commands too. The dev
  suggested npm run dev, but I’ll
  avoid that for now since it’s
  interactive and requires a
  browser. I’ll inspect the data
  file for the path and metadata.

• Explored
  └ Read RESEARCH-2.md

• I need to confirm the data
  using the validate:data
  function. I should also check
  that the JSON structure follows
  the path
  subject->grade->domain->standar
  d and that the domain meets
  progression edge conditions. It
  seems like validate:data should
  cover these checks, but for
  AC1, I can quickly parse the
  JSON to verify. I wonder if
  validate:data explicitly checks
  AC1, though. I guess I’ll run
  it anyway and also check the
  meta fields. Locating the
  scripts in the curriculum-
  viewer for validate:data isn’t
  necessary right now, but I'll
  proceed with running the
  command.

• I noticed there's an issue with
  the sample full path not
  matching the expected JSON
  structure; it might be about
  normalized arrays with nodes.
  It seems like my initial
  assumption was off since the
  validate-data says it's valid.
  I think I need to take a closer
  look at the structure, so I'll
  print out the top-level keys
  using Python to better
  understand what's going on.
  Let's figure this out!

    'children_ids', 'source'])

• I'm focusing on a nodes-based
  graph and need to ensure that
  the full path from subject to
  grade to domain to standard
  exists. I think I need to check
  the node types and their
  children to build a traversal
  method. I'll look for at least
  one subject node with a
  corresponding child grade node.
  I should also check if the
  domain_code and grade appear in
  the nodes' meta. To clarify the
  node shape, I’ll open the
  specified contract file.

• I'm thinking about writing a
  script to parse nodes and group
  the domain codes to their
  respective grades. I want to
  check if any of them have at
  least two adjacent grades. I'll
  also need to verify the full
  path. This means finding a
  subject node that connects to a
  grade child, then a domain
  child, and finally a standard
  child while ensuring the type
  checks out. Plus, I can rely on
  a validation script to check
  the hierarchy, though it might
  not verify the existence of a
  full path, but that seems
  implied.

• I need to read a file and
  validate the changes made in
  development. I should perform
  some tool calls like using
  'sed' to access the QA file,
  and then read the ticket and
  referenced files. After that,
  running test commands seems
  necessary. I'm wondering if I
  should use a plan for this, but
  maybe I can just take a
  straightforward approach with a
  single request. For now, I’ll
  focus on running 'sed' to read
  the QA file.

• Explored
  └ Read qa_4d74fcf055.md

• This request feels similar to
  the previous one; it's the same
  ticket and tests. We just
  validated the data for that
  earlier request. Still, the
  requirement mentions that it’s
  possible to run commands again,
  so why not rerun it? It's quick
  and should be straightforward.
  I'll make sure to confirm the
  AC path and any meta
  information too. So, let's
  proceed with the validate:data
  command once more.

• I should mention doing a prior
  check and confirm the sample
  path metadata and progression
  using Python. It seems running
  this check is optional, but I
  think it’s good to include an
  AC check in the report. It’s a
  good practice to run it quickly
  just to ensure everything is
  accurate. Keeping tabs on the
  details could save us some
  trouble later! So, I’ll move
  forward with that.

• I’m focused on creating a
  report, starting with a clear
  first line. I should include a
  summary of the command run and
  its output while noting that
  there are no changes to report.
  Additionally, the QA file
  references the same ticket, so
  I’ll mention that without
  needing to read it again. Once
  I’ve crafted everything, I need
  to ensure that the marker is
  precise at the very end,
  including the QA report inside
  it. Let's get started!

• I need to read the file and
  verify any development changes.
  The first step is to output
  "OK" or "FAIL" on the first
  line, making sure to include a
  marker at the end exactly as
  required. I’ll follow the same
  approach from previous tasks,
  opening the file, gathering the
  necessary evidence from the
  referenced ticket, and running
  test commands if possible. It
  seems like another request
  following a similar pattern.
  I'll be using tools for this.

• I'm thinking about not running
  the development due to the
  potential long run. I should
  gather evidence for mapping and
  also make note of warnings from
  the tests regarding the act and
  router for future reference.
  It’s important to mention these
  issues as non-failing ones,
  too. Additionally, I want to
  make sure there’s a marker at
  the end with the report body
  included. This will help keep
  everything organized and clear!

  on the first line. Including
  test results would be ideal if
  possible. I must print the

  okay, but I need to double-
  check everything. I’ll go
  through the ticket, the
  contract, and data-contract.md
  to make sure I'm on the right
  track. Then, I'll run
  validate:data and npm test to

• I need to look at the RESEARCH-
  2 ticket to confirm the content
  and validate the data. There
  won't be any changes, but I
  must confirm the acceptance
  criteria. I’m planning to open
  the ticket and reference
  related documents, likely
  regarding the math curriculum
  sample data. I’ll run the npm
  run validate:data command in
  the curriculum-viewer, although
  I’m considering whether to run
  other commands too. The dev
  suggested npm run dev, but I’ll
  avoid that for now since it’s
  interactive and requires a
  browser. I’ll inspect the data
  file for the path and metadata.

• Explored
  └ Read RESEARCH-2.md

• I need to confirm the data
  using the validate:data
  function. I should also check
  that the JSON structure follows
  the path
  subject->grade->domain->standar
  d and that the domain meets
  progression edge conditions. It
  seems like validate:data should
  cover these checks, but for
  AC1, I can quickly parse the
  JSON to verify. I wonder if
  validate:data explicitly checks
  AC1, though. I guess I’ll run
  it anyway and also check the
  meta fields. Locating the
  scripts in the curriculum-
  viewer for validate:data isn’t
  necessary right now, but I'll
  proceed with running the
  command.

• I noticed there's an issue with
  the sample full path not
  matching the expected JSON
  structure; it might be about
  normalized arrays with nodes.
  It seems like my initial
  assumption was off since the
  validate-data says it's valid.
  I think I need to take a closer
  look at the structure, so I'll
  print out the top-level keys
  using Python to better
  understand what's going on.
  Let's figure this out!

    'children_ids', 'source'])

• I'm focusing on a nodes-based
  graph and need to ensure that
  the full path from subject to
  grade to domain to standard
  exists. I think I need to check
  the node types and their
  children to build a traversal
  method. I'll look for at least
  one subject node with a
  corresponding child grade node.
  I should also check if the
  domain_code and grade appear in
  the nodes' meta. To clarify the
  node shape, I’ll open the
  specified contract file.

• I'm thinking about writing a
  script to parse nodes and group
  the domain codes to their
  respective grades. I want to
  check if any of them have at
  least two adjacent grades. I'll
  also need to verify the full
  path. This means finding a
  subject node that connects to a
  grade child, then a domain
  child, and finally a standard
  child while ensuring the type
  checks out. Plus, I can rely on
  a validation script to check
  the hierarchy, though it might
  not verify the existence of a
  full path, but that seems
  implied.

• I need to read a file and
  validate the changes made in
  development. I should perform
  some tool calls like using
  'sed' to access the QA file,
  and then read the ticket and
  referenced files. After that,
  running test commands seems
  necessary. I'm wondering if I
  should use a plan for this, but
  maybe I can just take a
  straightforward approach with a
  single request. For now, I’ll
  focus on running 'sed' to read
  the QA file.

• Explored
  └ Read qa_4d74fcf055.md

• This request feels similar to
  the previous one; it's the same
  ticket and tests. We just
  validated the data for that
  earlier request. Still, the
  requirement mentions that it’s
  possible to run commands again,
  so why not rerun it? It's quick
  and should be straightforward.
  I'll make sure to confirm the
  AC path and any meta
  information too. So, let's
  proceed with the validate:data
  command once more.

• Ran cd curriculum-viewer && npm
  │ run validate:data
  └
    > curriculum-viewer@0.0.0
    … +4 lines
    OK: curriculum_math_v1.json
    is valid

• I should mention doing a prior
  check and confirm the sample
  path metadata and progression
  using Python. It seems running
  this check is optional, but I
  think it’s good to include an
  AC check in the report. It’s a
  good practice to run it quickly
  just to ensure everything is
  accurate. Keeping tabs on the
  details could save us some
  trouble later! So, I’ll move
  forward with that.

• Ran python - <<'PY'

    'ko-KR', 'generated_at':
    '2025-12-30'}

• I’m focused on creating a
  report, starting with a clear
  first line. I should include a
  summary of the command run and
  its output while noting that
  there are no changes to report.
  Additionally, the QA file
  references the same ticket, so
  I’ll mention that without
  needing to read it again. Once
  I’ve crafted everything, I need
  to ensure that the marker is
  precise at the very end,
  including the QA report inside
  it. Let's get started!

• I need to read the file and
  verify any development changes.
  The first step is to output
  "OK" or "FAIL" on the first
  line, making sure to include a
  marker at the end exactly as
  required. I’ll follow the same
  approach from previous tasks,
  opening the file, gathering the
  necessary evidence from the
  referenced ticket, and running
  test commands if possible. It
  seems like another request
  following a similar pattern.
  I'll be using tools for this.

• I'm thinking about not running
  the development due to the
  potential long run. I should
  gather evidence for mapping and
  also make note of warnings from
  the tests regarding the act and
  router for future reference.
  It’s important to mention these
  issues as non-failing ones,
  too. Additionally, I want to
  make sure there’s a marker at
  the end with the report body
  included. This will help keep
  everything organized and clear!

• I need to look at the RESEARCH-
  2 ticket to confirm the content
  and validate the data. There
  won't be any changes, but I
  must confirm the acceptance
  criteria. I’m planning to open
  the ticket and reference
  related documents, likely
  regarding the math curriculum
  sample data. I’ll run the npm
  run validate:data command in
  the curriculum-viewer, although
  I’m considering whether to run
  other commands too. The dev
  suggested npm run dev, but I’ll
  avoid that for now since it’s
  interactive and requires a
  browser. I’ll inspect the data
  file for the path and metadata.

• I need to confirm the data
  using the validate:data
  function. I should also check
  that the JSON structure follows
  the path
  subject->grade->domain->standar
  d and that the domain meets
  progression edge conditions. It
  seems like validate:data should
  cover these checks, but for
  AC1, I can quickly parse the
  JSON to verify. I wonder if
  validate:data explicitly checks
  AC1, though. I guess I’ll run
  it anyway and also check the
  meta fields. Locating the
  scripts in the curriculum-
  viewer for validate:data isn’t
  necessary right now, but I'll
  proceed with running the
  command.

• I noticed there's an issue with
  the sample full path not
  matching the expected JSON
  structure; it might be about
  normalized arrays with nodes.
  It seems like my initial
  assumption was off since the
  validate-data says it's valid.
  I think I need to take a closer
  look at the structure, so I'll
  print out the top-level keys
  using Python to better
  understand what's going on.
  Let's figure this out!

• I'm focusing on a nodes-based
  graph and need to ensure that
  the full path from subject to
  grade to domain to standard
  exists. I think I need to check
  the node types and their
  children to build a traversal
  method. I'll look for at least
  one subject node with a
  corresponding child grade node.
  I should also check if the
  domain_code and grade appear in
  the nodes' meta. To clarify the
  node shape, I’ll open the
  specified contract file.

  least two adjacent grades. I'll
  also need to verify the full
  path. This means finding a
  subject node that connects to a
  grade child, then a domain
  child, and finally a standard
  child while ensuring the type
  checks out. Plus, I can rely on
  a validation script to check
  the hierarchy, though it might
  not verify the existence of a
  full path, but that seems

  necessary. I'm wondering if I
  should use a plan for this, but
  maybe I can just take a

  so why not rerun it? It's quick

• I should mention doing a prior
  check and confirm the sample
  path metadata and progression
  using Python. It seems running
  this check is optional, but I
  think it’s good to include an
  AC check in the report. It’s a
  good practice to run it quickly
  just to ensure everything is
  accurate. Keeping tabs on the
  details could save us some
  trouble later! So, I’ll move
  forward with that.

• I’m focused on creating a
  report, starting with a clear
  first line. I should include a
  summary of the command run and
  its output while noting that
  there are no changes to report.
  Additionally, the QA file
  references the same ticket, so
  I’ll mention that without
  needing to read it again. Once
  I’ve crafted everything, I need
  to ensure that the marker is
  precise at the very end,
  including the QA report inside
  it. Let's get started!

• I need to read the QA file and
  run tests, which sounds
  crucial. I’m considering using
  parallel reads to speed things
  up. It could be efficient! I’ll
  probably need to use the
  shell_command for this process.
  Okay, so coordinating those
  reads and ensuring the tests
  are executed properly is
  definitely on my mind. I want
  to make sure everything runs
  smoothly to get accurate
  results. Let's see how this
  goes!

• I need to read the file and
  verify any development changes.
  The first step is to output
  "OK" or "FAIL" on the first
  line, making sure to include a
  marker at the end exactly as
  required. I’ll follow the same
  approach from previous tasks,
  opening the file, gathering the
  necessary evidence from the
  referenced ticket, and running
  test commands if possible. It
  seems like another request
  following a similar pattern.
  I'll be using tools for this.

• I'm thinking about not running
  the development due to the
  potential long run. I should
  gather evidence for mapping and
  also make note of warnings from
  the tests regarding the act and
  router for future reference.
  It’s important to mention these
  issues as non-failing ones,
  too. Additionally, I want to
  make sure there’s a marker at
  the end with the report body
  included. This will help keep
  everything organized and clear!

• I need to read the file and

  changes, outputting OK or FAIL
  on the first line. Including
  test results would be ideal if
  possible. I must print the
  markers at the end exactly as
  specified. I'll follow the
  established patterns and
  potentially run some commands.
  First, I'll check the QA
  request file, ticket, and
  referenced documents before
  running the specified tests.
  Alright, I'm ready to proceed

  okay, but I need to double-
  check everything. I’ll go
  through the ticket, the
  contract, and data-contract.md
  to make sure I'm on the right
  track. Then, I'll run
  validate:data and npm test to
  confirm everything is

• I need to look at the RESEARCH-
  2 ticket to confirm the content
  and validate the data. There
  won't be any changes, but I
  must confirm the acceptance
  criteria. I’m planning to open
  the ticket and reference
  related documents, likely
  regarding the math curriculum
  sample data. I’ll run the npm
  run validate:data command in
  the curriculum-viewer, although
  I’m considering whether to run
  other commands too. The dev
  suggested npm run dev, but I’ll
  avoid that for now since it’s
  interactive and requires a
  browser. I’ll inspect the data
  file for the path and metadata.

• Explored
  └ Read RESEARCH-2.md

• I need to confirm the data
  using the validate:data
  function. I should also check
  that the JSON structure follows
  the path
  subject->grade->domain->standar
  d and that the domain meets
  progression edge conditions. It
  seems like validate:data should
  cover these checks, but for
  AC1, I can quickly parse the
  JSON to verify. I wonder if
  validate:data explicitly checks
  AC1, though. I guess I’ll run
  it anyway and also check the
  meta fields. Locating the
  scripts in the curriculum-
  viewer for validate:data isn’t
  necessary right now, but I'll
  proceed with running the
  command.

• I noticed there's an issue with
  the sample full path not
  matching the expected JSON
  structure; it might be about
  normalized arrays with nodes.
  It seems like my initial
  assumption was off since the
  validate-data says it's valid.
  I think I need to take a closer
  look at the structure, so I'll
  print out the top-level keys
  using Python to better
  understand what's going on.
  Let's figure this out!

    'children_ids', 'source'])

• I'm focusing on a nodes-based
  graph and need to ensure that
  the full path from subject to
  grade to domain to standard
  exists. I think I need to check
  the node types and their
  children to build a traversal
  method. I'll look for at least
  one subject node with a
  corresponding child grade node.
  I should also check if the
  domain_code and grade appear in
  the nodes' meta. To clarify the
  node shape, I’ll open the
  specified contract file.

• I'm thinking about writing a
  script to parse nodes and group
  the domain codes to their
  respective grades. I want to
  check if any of them have at
  least two adjacent grades. I'll
  also need to verify the full
  path. This means finding a
  subject node that connects to a
  grade child, then a domain
  child, and finally a standard
  child while ensuring the type
  checks out. Plus, I can rely on
  a validation script to check
  the hierarchy, though it might
  not verify the existence of a
  full path, but that seems
  implied.

• I need to read a file and
  validate the changes made in
  development. I should perform
  some tool calls like using
  'sed' to access the QA file,
  and then read the ticket and
  referenced files. After that,
  running test commands seems
  necessary. I'm wondering if I
  should use a plan for this, but
  maybe I can just take a
  straightforward approach with a
  single request. For now, I’ll
  focus on running 'sed' to read
  the QA file.

• Explored
  └ Read qa_4d74fcf055.md

• This request feels similar to
  the previous one; it's the same
  ticket and tests. We just
  validated the data for that
  earlier request. Still, the
  requirement mentions that it’s
  possible to run commands again,
  so why not rerun it? It's quick
  and should be straightforward.
  I'll make sure to confirm the
  AC path and any meta
  information too. So, let's
  proceed with the validate:data
  command once more.

• Ran cd curriculum-viewer && npm
  │ run validate:data
  └
    > curriculum-viewer@0.0.0
    … +4 lines
    OK: curriculum_math_v1.json
    is valid

• I should mention doing a prior
  check and confirm the sample
  path metadata and progression
  using Python. It seems running
  this check is optional, but I
  think it’s good to include an
  AC check in the report. It’s a
  good practice to run it quickly
  just to ensure everything is
  accurate. Keeping tabs on the
  details could save us some
  trouble later! So, I’ll move
  forward with that.

• Ran python - <<'PY'

    'ko-KR', 'generated_at':
    '2025-12-30'}

• I’m focused on creating a
  report, starting with a clear
  first line. I should include a
  summary of the command run and
  its output while noting that
  there are no changes to report.
  Additionally, the QA file
  references the same ticket, so
  I’ll mention that without
  needing to read it again. Once
  I’ve crafted everything, I need
  to ensure that the marker is
  precise at the very end,
  including the QA report inside
  it. Let's get started!

• I need to respond with OK/FAIL
  for the new request file. I’ll
  read it, run the test command,
  and summarize the findings. It
  seems like it’s similar to the
  RESEARCH-2 repeating task, but
  I’ll still follow the
  instructions to read the file
  and output the markers. I’ll
  use the shell command for that
  and run the validate:data
  command. Even though I’ve done
  this multiple times, the
  instructions allow for another
  run. I'll also prepare the
  Korean report and finish it
  with the markers.

• I need to read the file and
  verify any development changes.
  The first step is to output
  "OK" or "FAIL" on the first
  line, making sure to include a
  marker at the end exactly as
  required. I’ll follow the same
  approach from previous tasks,
  opening the file, gathering the
  necessary evidence from the
  referenced ticket, and running
  test commands if possible. It
  seems like another request
  following a similar pattern.
  I'll be using tools for this.

• I'm thinking about not running
  the development due to the
  potential long run. I should
  gather evidence for mapping and
  also make note of warnings from
  the tests regarding the act and
  router for future reference.
  It’s important to mention these
  issues as non-failing ones,
  too. Additionally, I want to
  make sure there’s a marker at
  the end with the report body
  included. This will help keep
  everything organized and clear!

• I need to look at the RESEARCH-
  2 ticket to confirm the content
  and validate the data. There
  won't be any changes, but I
  must confirm the acceptance
  criteria. I’m planning to open
  the ticket and reference
  related documents, likely
  regarding the math curriculum
  sample data. I’ll run the npm
  run validate:data command in
  the curriculum-viewer, although
  I’m considering whether to run
  other commands too. The dev
  suggested npm run dev, but I’ll
  avoid that for now since it’s
  interactive and requires a
  browser. I’ll inspect the data
  file for the path and metadata.

• Explored
  └ Read RESEARCH-2.md

• I need to confirm the data
  using the validate:data
  function. I should also check
  that the JSON structure follows
  the path
  subject->grade->domain->standar
  d and that the domain meets
  progression edge conditions. It
  seems like validate:data should
  cover these checks, but for
  AC1, I can quickly parse the
  JSON to verify. I wonder if
  validate:data explicitly checks
  AC1, though. I guess I’ll run
  it anyway and also check the
  meta fields. Locating the
  scripts in the curriculum-
  viewer for validate:data isn’t
  necessary right now, but I'll
  proceed with running the
  command.

• I noticed there's an issue with
  the sample full path not
  matching the expected JSON
  structure; it might be about
  normalized arrays with nodes.
  It seems like my initial
  assumption was off since the
  validate-data says it's valid.
  I think I need to take a closer
  look at the structure, so I'll
  print out the top-level keys
  using Python to better
  understand what's going on.
  Let's figure this out!

    'children_ids', 'source'])

• I'm focusing on a nodes-based
  graph and need to ensure that
  the full path from subject to
  grade to domain to standard
  exists. I think I need to check
  the node types and their
  children to build a traversal
  method. I'll look for at least
  one subject node with a
  corresponding child grade node.
  I should also check if the
  domain_code and grade appear in
  the nodes' meta. To clarify the
  node shape, I’ll open the
  specified contract file.

• I'm thinking about writing a
  script to parse nodes and group
  the domain codes to their
  respective grades. I want to
  check if any of them have at
  least two adjacent grades. I'll
  also need to verify the full
  path. This means finding a
  subject node that connects to a
  grade child, then a domain
  child, and finally a standard
  child while ensuring the type
  checks out. Plus, I can rely on
  a validation script to check
  the hierarchy, though it might
  not verify the existence of a
  full path, but that seems
  implied.

  development. I should perform
  some tool calls like using
  'sed' to access the QA file,
  and then read the ticket and
  referenced files. After that,
  running test commands seems
  necessary. I'm wondering if I
  should use a plan for this, but
  maybe I can just take a
  straightforward approach with a
  single request. For now, I’ll
  focus on running 'sed' to read
  the QA file.

• Explored
  └ Read qa_4d74fcf055.md

• This request feels similar to
  the previous one; it's the same
  ticket and tests. We just
  validated the data for that
  earlier request. Still, the
  requirement mentions that it’s
  possible to run commands again,
  so why not rerun it? It's quick
  and should be straightforward.
  I'll make sure to confirm the
  AC path and any meta
  information too. So, let's
  proceed with the validate:data
  command once more.

• Ran cd curriculum-viewer && npm
  │ run validate:data
  └
    > curriculum-viewer@0.0.0
    … +4 lines
    OK: curriculum_math_v1.json
    is valid

• I should mention doing a prior
  check and confirm the sample
  path metadata and progression
  using Python. It seems running
  this check is optional, but I
  think it’s good to include an
  AC check in the report. It’s a
  good practice to run it quickly
  just to ensure everything is
  accurate. Keeping tabs on the
  details could save us some
  trouble later! So, I’ll move
  forward with that.

• Ran python - <<'PY'
  │ import json
  │ from collections import
  │ … +72 lines
  └ full_path ('MATH-2022',
    'MATH-2022-G-1',
    … +9 lines
    'ko-KR', 'generated_at':
    '2025-12-30'}

• I’m focused on creating a
  report, starting with a clear
  first line. I should include a
  summary of the command run and
  its output while noting that
  there are no changes to report.
  Additionally, the QA file
  references the same ticket, so
  I’ll mention that without
  needing to read it again. Once
  I’ve crafted everything, I need
  to ensure that the marker is
  precise at the very end,
  including the QA report inside
  it. Let's get started!

• I need to read the QA file and

  crucial. I’m considering using
  parallel reads to speed things
  up. It could be efficient! I’ll
  probably need to use the

  Okay, so coordinating those

  are executed properly is
  definitely on my mind. I want

• I need to respond with OK/FAIL
  for the new request file. I’ll
  read it, run the test command,
  and summarize the findings. It
  seems like it’s similar to the
  RESEARCH-2 repeating task, but
  I’ll still follow the
  instructions to read the file
  and output the markers. I’ll
  use the shell command for that
  and run the validate:data
  command. Even though I’ve done
  this multiple times, the
  instructions allow for another
  run. I'll also prepare the
  Korean report and finish it
  with the markers.

• I need to read the file and
  validate the development
  changes, outputting OK or FAIL
  on the first line. Including
  test results would be ideal if
  possible. I must print the
  markers at the end exactly as
  specified. I'll follow the
  established patterns and
  potentially run some commands.
  First, I'll check the QA
  request file, ticket, and
  referenced documents before
  running the specified tests.
  Alright, I'm ready to proceed
  with the tool calls!

• I'm looking at the task similar
  to RESEARCH-1B, which is likely
  okay, but I need to double-
  check everything. I’ll go
  through the ticket, the
  contract, and data-contract.md
  to make sure I'm on the right
  track. Then, I'll run
  validate:data and npm test to
  confirm everything is
  functioning as expected. It
  looks like I can handle these
  processes simultaneously with
  tool calls to save time and
  ensure accuracy!

• I need to look at the RESEARCH-
  2 ticket to confirm the content
  and validate the data. There
  won't be any changes, but I
  must confirm the acceptance
  criteria. I’m planning to open
  the ticket and reference
  related documents, likely
  regarding the math curriculum
  sample data. I’ll run the npm
  run validate:data command in
  the curriculum-viewer, although
  I’m considering whether to run
  other commands too. The dev
  suggested npm run dev, but I’ll
  avoid that for now since it’s
  interactive and requires a
  browser. I’ll inspect the data
  file for the path and metadata.

• Explored
  └ Read RESEARCH-2.md

• I need to confirm the data
  using the validate:data
  function. I should also check
  that the JSON structure follows
  the path
  subject->grade->domain->standar
  d and that the domain meets
  progression edge conditions. It
  seems like validate:data should
  cover these checks, but for
  AC1, I can quickly parse the
  JSON to verify. I wonder if
  validate:data explicitly checks
  AC1, though. I guess I’ll run
  it anyway and also check the
  meta fields. Locating the
  scripts in the curriculum-
  viewer for validate:data isn’t
  necessary right now, but I'll
  proceed with running the
  command.

• I noticed there's an issue with
  the sample full path not
  matching the expected JSON
  structure; it might be about
  normalized arrays with nodes.
  It seems like my initial
  assumption was off since the
  validate-data says it's valid.
  I think I need to take a closer
  look at the structure, so I'll
  print out the top-level keys
  using Python to better
  understand what's going on.
  Let's figure this out!

    'children_ids', 'source'])

• I'm focusing on a nodes-based
  graph and need to ensure that
  the full path from subject to
  grade to domain to standard
  exists. I think I need to check
  the node types and their
  children to build a traversal
  method. I'll look for at least
  one subject node with a
  corresponding child grade node.
  I should also check if the
  domain_code and grade appear in
  the nodes' meta. To clarify the
  node shape, I’ll open the
  specified contract file.

• I'm thinking about writing a
  script to parse nodes and group
  the domain codes to their
  respective grades. I want to
  check if any of them have at
  least two adjacent grades. I'll
  also need to verify the full
  path. This means finding a
  subject node that connects to a
  grade child, then a domain
  child, and finally a standard
  child while ensuring the type
  checks out. Plus, I can rely on
  a validation script to check
  the hierarchy, though it might
  not verify the existence of a
  full path, but that seems
  implied.

• I need to read a file and
  validate the changes made in
  development. I should perform
  some tool calls like using
  'sed' to access the QA file,
  and then read the ticket and
  referenced files. After that,
  running test commands seems
  necessary. I'm wondering if I
  should use a plan for this, but
  maybe I can just take a
  straightforward approach with a
  single request. For now, I’ll
  focus on running 'sed' to read
  the QA file.

• Explored
  └ Read qa_4d74fcf055.md

• This request feels similar to
  the previous one; it's the same
  ticket and tests. We just
  validated the data for that
  earlier request. Still, the
  requirement mentions that it’s
  possible to run commands again,
  so why not rerun it? It's quick
  and should be straightforward.
  I'll make sure to confirm the
  AC path and any meta
  information too. So, let's
  proceed with the validate:data
  command once more.

• Ran cd curriculum-viewer && npm
  │ run validate:data
  └
    > curriculum-viewer@0.0.0
    … +4 lines
    OK: curriculum_math_v1.json

• I should mention doing a prior
  check and confirm the sample
  path metadata and progression
  using Python. It seems running
  this check is optional, but I
  think it’s good to include an
  AC check in the report. It’s a
  good practice to run it quickly
  just to ensure everything is
  accurate. Keeping tabs on the
  details could save us some
  trouble later! So, I’ll move
  forward with that.

• I’m focused on creating a
  report, starting with a clear
  first line. I should include a
  summary of the command run and
  its output while noting that
  there are no changes to report.
  Additionally, the QA file
  references the same ticket, so
  I’ll mention that without
  needing to read it again. Once
  I’ve crafted everything, I need
  to ensure that the marker is
  precise at the very end,
  including the QA report inside
  it. Let's get started!

• I need to respond with OK/FAIL
  for the new request file. I’ll
  read it, run the test command,
  and summarize the findings. It
  seems like it’s similar to the
  RESEARCH-2 repeating task, but
  I’ll still follow the
  instructions to read the file
  and output the markers. I’ll
  use the shell command for that
  and run the validate:data
  command. Even though I’ve done
  this multiple times, the
  instructions allow for another
  run. I'll also prepare the
  Korean report and finish it
  with the markers.

• I need to look at the RESEARCH-
  2 ticket to confirm the content
  and validate the data. There
  won't be any changes, but I
  must confirm the acceptance
  criteria. I’m planning to open
  the ticket and reference
  related documents, likely
  regarding the math curriculum
  sample data. I’ll run the npm
  run validate:data command in
  the curriculum-viewer, although
  I’m considering whether to run
  other commands too. The dev
  suggested npm run dev, but I’ll
  avoid that for now since it’s
  interactive and requires a
  browser. I’ll inspect the data
  file for the path and metadata.

• Explored
  └ Read RESEARCH-2.md

• I need to confirm the data
  using the validate:data
  function. I should also check
  that the JSON structure follows
  the path
  subject->grade->domain->standar
  d and that the domain meets
  progression edge conditions. It
  seems like validate:data should
  cover these checks, but for
  AC1, I can quickly parse the
  JSON to verify. I wonder if
  validate:data explicitly checks
  AC1, though. I guess I’ll run
  it anyway and also check the
  meta fields. Locating the
  scripts in the curriculum-
  viewer for validate:data isn’t
  necessary right now, but I'll
  proceed with running the
  command.

• I noticed there's an issue with
  the sample full path not
  matching the expected JSON
  structure; it might be about
  normalized arrays with nodes.
  It seems like my initial
  assumption was off since the
  validate-data says it's valid.
  I think I need to take a closer
  look at the structure, so I'll
  print out the top-level keys
  using Python to better
  understand what's going on.
  Let's figure this out!

    'children_ids', 'source'])

• I'm focusing on a nodes-based
  graph and need to ensure that
  the full path from subject to
  grade to domain to standard
  exists. I think I need to check
  the node types and their
  children to build a traversal
  method. I'll look for at least
  one subject node with a
  corresponding child grade node.
  I should also check if the
  domain_code and grade appear in
  the nodes' meta. To clarify the
  node shape, I’ll open the
  specified contract file.

• I'm thinking about writing a
  script to parse nodes and group
  the domain codes to their
  respective grades. I want to
  check if any of them have at
  least two adjacent grades. I'll
  also need to verify the full
  path. This means finding a
  subject node that connects to a
  grade child, then a domain
  child, and finally a standard
  child while ensuring the type
  checks out. Plus, I can rely on
  a validation script to check
  the hierarchy, though it might
  not verify the existence of a
  full path, but that seems
  implied.

• I need to read a file and
  validate the changes made in
  development. I should perform
  some tool calls like using
  'sed' to access the QA file,
  and then read the ticket and
  referenced files. After that,
  running test commands seems
  necessary. I'm wondering if I
  should use a plan for this, but
  maybe I can just take a
  straightforward approach with a
  single request. For now, I’ll
  focus on running 'sed' to read
  the QA file.

• Explored
  └ Read qa_4d74fcf055.md

• This request feels similar to
  the previous one; it's the same
  ticket and tests. We just
  validated the data for that
  earlier request. Still, the
  requirement mentions that it’s
  possible to run commands again,
  so why not rerun it? It's quick
  and should be straightforward.
  I'll make sure to confirm the
  AC path and any meta
  information too. So, let's
  proceed with the validate:data
  command once more.

• Ran cd curriculum-viewer && npm
  │ run validate:data
  └
    > curriculum-viewer@0.0.0
    … +4 lines
    OK: curriculum_math_v1.json
    is valid

• I should mention doing a prior
  check and confirm the sample
  path metadata and progression
  using Python. It seems running
  this check is optional, but I
  think it’s good to include an
  AC check in the report. It’s a
  good practice to run it quickly
  just to ensure everything is
  accurate. Keeping tabs on the
  details could save us some
  trouble later! So, I’ll move
  forward with that.

• Ran python - <<'PY'
  │ import json
  │ from collections import
  │ … +72 lines
  └ full_path ('MATH-2022',
    'MATH-2022-G-1',
    … +9 lines
    'ko-KR', 'generated_at':
    '2025-12-30'}

• I’m focused on creating a
  report, starting with a clear
  first line. I should include a
  summary of the command run and
  its output while noting that
  there are no changes to report.
  Additionally, the QA file
  references the same ticket, so
  I’ll mention that without
  needing to read it again. Once
  I’ve crafted everything, I need
  to ensure that the marker is
  precise at the very end,
  including the QA report inside
  it. Let's get started!

• I need to respond with OK/FAIL
  for the new request file. I’ll
  read it, run the test command,
  and summarize the findings. It
  seems like it’s similar to the
  RESEARCH-2 repeating task, but
  I’ll still follow the
  instructions to read the file
  and output the markers. I’ll
  use the shell command for that
  and run the validate:data
  command. Even though I’ve done
  this multiple times, the
  instructions allow for another
  run. I'll also prepare the
  Korean report and finish it
  with the markers.

• I need to read the file and
  validate the development
  changes, outputting OK or FAIL
  on the first line. Including
  test results would be ideal if
  possible. I must print the
  markers at the end exactly as
  specified. I'll follow the
  established patterns and
  potentially run some commands.
  First, I'll check the QA
  request file, ticket, and
  referenced documents before
  running the specified tests.
  Alright, I'm ready to proceed
  with the tool calls!

• I'm looking at the task similar
  to RESEARCH-1B, which is likely
  okay, but I need to double-
  check everything. I’ll go
  through the ticket, the
  contract, and data-contract.md
  to make sure I'm on the right
  track. Then, I'll run

• I need to look at the RESEARCH-
  2 ticket to confirm the content
  and validate the data. There
  won't be any changes, but I
  must confirm the acceptance
  criteria. I’m planning to open
  the ticket and reference
  related documents, likely
  regarding the math curriculum
  sample data. I’ll run the npm
  run validate:data command in
  the curriculum-viewer, although
  I’m considering whether to run
  other commands too. The dev
  suggested npm run dev, but I’ll
  avoid that for now since it’s
  interactive and requires a
  browser. I’ll inspect the data
  file for the path and metadata.

• Explored
  └ Read RESEARCH-2.md

• I need to confirm the data
  using the validate:data
  function. I should also check
  that the JSON structure follows
  the path
  subject->grade->domain->standar
  d and that the domain meets
  progression edge conditions. It
  seems like validate:data should
  cover these checks, but for
  AC1, I can quickly parse the
  JSON to verify. I wonder if
  validate:data explicitly checks
  AC1, though. I guess I’ll run
  it anyway and also check the
  meta fields. Locating the
  scripts in the curriculum-
  viewer for validate:data isn’t
  necessary right now, but I'll
  proceed with running the
  command.

• I noticed there's an issue with
  the sample full path not
  matching the expected JSON
  structure; it might be about
  normalized arrays with nodes.
  It seems like my initial
  assumption was off since the
  validate-data says it's valid.
  I think I need to take a closer
  look at the structure, so I'll
  print out the top-level keys
  using Python to better
  understand what's going on.
  Let's figure this out!

    'title', 'subject',
    'children_ids', 'source'])

• I'm focusing on a nodes-based
  graph and need to ensure that
  the full path from subject to
  grade to domain to standard
  exists. I think I need to check
  the node types and their
  children to build a traversal
  method. I'll look for at least
  one subject node with a
  corresponding child grade node.
  I should also check if the
  domain_code and grade appear in
  the nodes' meta. To clarify the
  node shape, I’ll open the
  specified contract file.

• I'm thinking about writing a
  script to parse nodes and group
  the domain codes to their
  respective grades. I want to
  check if any of them have at
  least two adjacent grades. I'll
  also need to verify the full
  path. This means finding a
  subject node that connects to a
  grade child, then a domain
  child, and finally a standard
  child while ensuring the type
  checks out. Plus, I can rely on
  a validation script to check
  the hierarchy, though it might
  not verify the existence of a
  full path, but that seems
  implied.

• I need to read a file and
  validate the changes made in
  development. I should perform
  some tool calls like using
  'sed' to access the QA file,
  and then read the ticket and
  referenced files. After that,
  running test commands seems
  necessary. I'm wondering if I
  should use a plan for this, but
  maybe I can just take a
  straightforward approach with a
  single request. For now, I’ll
  focus on running 'sed' to read
  the QA file.

• Explored
  └ Read qa_4d74fcf055.md

• This request feels similar to
  the previous one; it's the same
  ticket and tests. We just
  validated the data for that
  earlier request. Still, the
  requirement mentions that it’s
  possible to run commands again,
  so why not rerun it? It's quick
  and should be straightforward.
  I'll make sure to confirm the
  AC path and any meta
  information too. So, let's
  proceed with the validate:data
  command once more.

• Ran cd curriculum-viewer && npm
  │ run validate:data
  └
    > curriculum-viewer@0.0.0
    … +4 lines
    OK: curriculum_math_v1.json

• I should mention doing a prior
  check and confirm the sample
  path metadata and progression
  using Python. It seems running
  this check is optional, but I
  think it’s good to include an
  AC check in the report. It’s a
  good practice to run it quickly
  just to ensure everything is
  accurate. Keeping tabs on the
  details could save us some
  trouble later! So, I’ll move
  forward with that.

• Ran python - <<'PY'

    '2025-12-30'}

• I’m focused on creating a
  report, starting with a clear
  first line. I should include a
  summary of the command run and
  its output while noting that
  there are no changes to report.
  Additionally, the QA file
  references the same ticket, so
  I’ll mention that without
  needing to read it again. Once
  I’ve crafted everything, I need
  to ensure that the marker is
  precise at the very end,
  including the QA report inside
  it. Let's get started!

• I need to respond with OK/FAIL
  for the new request file. I’ll
  read it, run the test command,
  and summarize the findings. It
  seems like it’s similar to the
  RESEARCH-2 repeating task, but
  I’ll still follow the
  instructions to read the file
  and output the markers. I’ll
  use the shell command for that
  and run the validate:data
  command. Even though I’ve done
  this multiple times, the
  instructions allow for another
  run. I'll also prepare the
  Korean report and finish it
  with the markers.

• I need to handle a new request which involves
  reading a QA file to verify development changes,
  determining if the output is OK or FAIL. The first
  line should start with either OK or FAIL, and the
  last marker block must match exactly what's in the
  file. I plan to read both the QA and ticket files,
  run necessary commands (likely validate:data), and
  ensure there's no duplication. I'll proceed using
  shell_command for reading files and execute
  everything in parallel.

• I realized that the parallel process read the wrong
  ticket file, RESEARCH-2A instead of RESEARCH-1. I
  need to switch to reading RESEARCH-1 along with the
  contract document. I plan to run validate:data and
  npm test as instructed. For RESEARCH-1, I'll use sed
  and check the contract document for essential
  sections, like type tables and ID rules with
  examples. I'll also run tests since earlier outputs
  show that the tests pass. We can do this
  efficiently!

  Clarifying requirements

  I see the user instruction states that the first
  line should say OK/FAIL, with the marker at the end.
  It doesn't specify needing the token inside the
  marker, which is different from what's required for
  earlier ticket RESEARCH-2A. For this request, I’ll
  run both validate:data and npm test as the Dev
  mentioned. I need to verify that the documentation
  modifications meet the acceptance criteria (AC).
  Reading RESEARCH-1 will help me understand those
  criteria better before inspecting the relevant
  document sections. I'll use rg to check section
  headers efficiently.

• I'm looking into the ticket AC requirements. I need
  to check if Dev updated the documentation and linked
  it properly. The QA file mentions changes to the
  contract doc and ticket RESEARCH-1, so I’ll open
  that to see if it includes the link to the Single
  Source of Truth document. It should contain
  necessary components like a count of example IDs (at
  least 10), validation rules with examples, and a
  mapping table. The document lists 12 items, which is
  promising so far!

  Checking rule requirements

  The AC mentions each rule should include examples,
  likely for major ones. I can do a quick check in
  section 5, where E1-E7 and W1 are listed with
  success/fail code blocks. W1 has a definition but
  might lack an example; I've got to make sure it has
  one. I'll search for "#### W1" to verify, and also
  check for "성공:" after each header, though that
  might be a bit too strict. The mapping table should
  be present, and I’ll prepare a QA report in Korean
  indicating OK since the tests pass.

  Reviewing test warnings and markers

  I need to note the warnings from the npm test
  regarding React Router's future flag and act
  warnings, but since the tests pass, they’re non-
  blocking. There’s a requirement that the last output
  must have specific markers. I’ll make sure to print
  the marker at the end, like ###BEGIN:eb0358d671###,
  while also including the report body inside. I
  should quickly check the W sections for examples, as
  missing ones might lead to a fail, but they’re
  likely acceptable. I'll use a shell command for
  efficiency!

• I need to confirm the count of examples for AC2,
  which should be 12. I can say "예시 12개" to
  indicate that. To be accurate, I'll compute the
  count using a script since I previously noted there
  were 12 items. Running a quick Python script sounds
  like a good option to count the IDs in the example
  section. Alternatively, I could use shell commands
  to count lines starting with '-' until I hit a blank
  line. I'll proceed with this approach!

• I'm considering including specific sections and
  their counts. I also want to mention any warnings
  from tests, but I’ll treat those as non-blocking for
  now. Additionally, I need to note that I didn't
  execute npm run dev due to it requiring interactive
  input. I've got to make sure to include those
  specific markers exactly as mentioned. It's
  essential to keep everything organized and clear for
  future reference!

  suggested npm run dev, but I’ll
  avoid that for now since it’s
  interactive and requires a
  browser. I’ll inspect the data
  file for the path and metadata.

• I need to confirm the data
  using the validate:data
  function. I should also check
  that the JSON structure follows
  the path
  subject->grade->domain->standar
  d and that the domain meets
  progression edge conditions. It
  seems like validate:data should
  cover these checks, but for
  AC1, I can quickly parse the
  JSON to verify. I wonder if
  validate:data explicitly checks
  AC1, though. I guess I’ll run
  it anyway and also check the
  meta fields. Locating the
  scripts in the curriculum-
  viewer for validate:data isn’t
  necessary right now, but I'll
  proceed with running the
  command.

• I noticed there's an issue with
  the sample full path not
  matching the expected JSON
  structure; it might be about
  normalized arrays with nodes.
  It seems like my initial
  assumption was off since the
  validate-data says it's valid.
  I think I need to take a closer
  look at the structure, so I'll
  print out the top-level keys
  using Python to better
  understand what's going on.
  Let's figure this out!

    'children_ids', 'source'])

• I'm focusing on a nodes-based
  graph and need to ensure that
  the full path from subject to
  grade to domain to standard
  exists. I think I need to check
  the node types and their
  children to build a traversal
  method. I'll look for at least
  one subject node with a
  corresponding child grade node.
  I should also check if the
  domain_code and grade appear in
  the nodes' meta. To clarify the
  node shape, I’ll open the
  specified contract file.

• I'm thinking about writing a
  script to parse nodes and group
  the domain codes to their
  respective grades. I want to
  check if any of them have at
  least two adjacent grades. I'll
  also need to verify the full
  path. This means finding a
  subject node that connects to a
  grade child, then a domain
  child, and finally a standard
  child while ensuring the type
  checks out. Plus, I can rely on
  a validation script to check
  the hierarchy, though it might
  not verify the existence of a
  full path, but that seems
  implied.

• I need to read a file and
  validate the changes made in
  development. I should perform
  some tool calls like using
  'sed' to access the QA file,
  and then read the ticket and
  referenced files. After that,
  running test commands seems
  necessary. I'm wondering if I
  should use a plan for this, but
  maybe I can just take a
  straightforward approach with a
  single request. For now, I’ll
  focus on running 'sed' to read
  the QA file.

• Explored
  └ Read qa_4d74fcf055.md

• This request feels similar to
  the previous one; it's the same
  ticket and tests. We just
  validated the data for that
  earlier request. Still, the
  requirement mentions that it’s
  possible to run commands again,
  so why not rerun it? It's quick
  and should be straightforward.
  I'll make sure to confirm the
  AC path and any meta
  information too. So, let's
  proceed with the validate:data
  command once more.

• Ran cd curriculum-viewer && npm
  │ run validate:data
  └
    > curriculum-viewer@0.0.0
    … +4 lines
    OK: curriculum_math_v1.json
    is valid

• I should mention doing a prior
  check and confirm the sample
  path metadata and progression
  using Python. It seems running
  this check is optional, but I
  think it’s good to include an
  AC check in the report. It’s a
  good practice to run it quickly
  just to ensure everything is
  accurate. Keeping tabs on the
  details could save us some
  trouble later! So, I’ll move
  forward with that.

• Ran python - <<'PY'
  │ import json
  │ from collections import
  │ … +72 lines
  └ full_path ('MATH-2022',
    'MATH-2022-G-1',
    … +9 lines
    'ko-KR', 'generated_at':
    '2025-12-30'}

• I’m focused on creating a
  report, starting with a clear
  first line. I should include a
  summary of the command run and
  its output while noting that
  there are no changes to report.
  Additionally, the QA file
  references the same ticket, so
  I’ll mention that without
  needing to read it again. Once
  I’ve crafted everything, I need
  to ensure that the marker is
  precise at the very end,
  including the QA report inside
  it. Let's get started!

• I need to read the QA file and

  crucial. I’m considering using
  parallel reads to speed things

  Okay, so coordinating those

• I need to respond with OK/FAIL
  for the new request file. I’ll
  read it, run the test command,
  and summarize the findings. It
  seems like it’s similar to the
  RESEARCH-2 repeating task, but
  I’ll still follow the
  instructions to read the file
  and output the markers. I’ll
  use the shell command for that
  and run the validate:data
  command. Even though I’ve done
  this multiple times, the
  instructions allow for another
  run. I'll also prepare the
  Korean report and finish it
  with the markers.

• I need to handle a new request which involves
  reading a QA file to verify development changes,
  determining if the output is OK or FAIL. The first
  line should start with either OK or FAIL, and the
  last marker block must match exactly what's in the
  file. I plan to read both the QA and ticket files,
  run necessary commands (likely validate:data), and
  ensure there's no duplication. I'll proceed using
  shell_command for reading files and execute
  everything in parallel.

    Read RESEARCH-2A.md

• I realized that the parallel process read the wrong
  ticket file, RESEARCH-2A instead of RESEARCH-1. I
  need to switch to reading RESEARCH-1 along with the
  contract document. I plan to run validate:data and
  npm test as instructed. For RESEARCH-1, I'll use sed
  and check the contract document for essential
  sections, like type tables and ID rules with
  examples. I'll also run tests since earlier outputs
  show that the tests pass. We can do this
  efficiently!

  Clarifying requirements

  I see the user instruction states that the first
  line should say OK/FAIL, with the marker at the end.
  It doesn't specify needing the token inside the
  marker, which is different from what's required for
  earlier ticket RESEARCH-2A. For this request, I’ll
  run both validate:data and npm test as the Dev

  modifications meet the acceptance criteria (AC).
  Reading RESEARCH-1 will help me understand those

  headers efficiently.

• I'm looking into the ticket AC requirements. I need
  to check if Dev updated the documentation and linked
  it properly. The QA file mentions changes to the
  contract doc and ticket RESEARCH-1, so I’ll open
  that to see if it includes the link to the Single
  Source of Truth document. It should contain
  necessary components like a count of example IDs (at
  least 10), validation rules with examples, and a
  mapping table. The document lists 12 items, which is
  promising so far!

  Checking rule requirements

  The AC mentions each rule should include examples,
  likely for major ones. I can do a quick check in
  section 5, where E1-E7 and W1 are listed with
  success/fail code blocks. W1 has a definition but
  might lack an example; I've got to make sure it has
  one. I'll search for "#### W1" to verify, and also
  check for "성공:" after each header, though that
  might be a bit too strict. The mapping table should
  be present, and I’ll prepare a QA report in Korean
  indicating OK since the tests pass.

  Reviewing test warnings and markers

  I need to note the warnings from the npm test
  regarding React Router's future flag and act
  warnings, but since the tests pass, they’re non-
  blocking. There’s a requirement that the last output
  must have specific markers. I’ll make sure to print
  the marker at the end, like ###BEGIN:eb0358d671###,
  while also including the report body inside. I
  should quickly check the W sections for examples, as
  missing ones might lead to a fail, but they’re
  likely acceptable. I'll use a shell command for
  efficiency!

• I need to confirm the count of examples for AC2,
  which should be 12. I can say "예시 12개" to
  indicate that. To be accurate, I'll compute the
  count using a script since I previously noted there
  were 12 items. Running a quick Python script sounds
  like a good option to count the IDs in the example
  section. Alternatively, I could use shell commands
  to count lines starting with '-' until I hit a blank
  line. I'll proceed with this approach!

  other commands too. The dev
  suggested npm run dev, but I’ll
  avoid that for now since it’s
  interactive and requires a
  browser. I’ll inspect the data
  file for the path and metadata.

• Explored
  └ Read RESEARCH-2.md

• I need to confirm the data
  using the validate:data
  function. I should also check
  that the JSON structure follows
  the path
  subject->grade->domain->standar
  d and that the domain meets
  progression edge conditions. It
  seems like validate:data should
  cover these checks, but for
  AC1, I can quickly parse the
  JSON to verify. I wonder if
  validate:data explicitly checks
  AC1, though. I guess I’ll run
  it anyway and also check the
  meta fields. Locating the
  scripts in the curriculum-
  viewer for validate:data isn’t
  necessary right now, but I'll
  proceed with running the
  command.

    progression candidate exists:
    False

• I noticed there's an issue with
  the sample full path not
  matching the expected JSON
  structure; it might be about
  normalized arrays with nodes.
  It seems like my initial
  assumption was off since the
  validate-data says it's valid.
  I think I need to take a closer
  look at the structure, so I'll
  print out the top-level keys
  using Python to better
  understand what's going on.
  Let's figure this out!

    'title', 'subject',
    'children_ids', 'source'])

• I'm focusing on a nodes-based
  graph and need to ensure that
  the full path from subject to
  grade to domain to standard
  exists. I think I need to check
  the node types and their
  children to build a traversal
  method. I'll look for at least
  one subject node with a
  corresponding child grade node.
  I should also check if the
  domain_code and grade appear in
  the nodes' meta. To clarify the
  node shape, I’ll open the
  specified contract file.

• I'm thinking about writing a
  script to parse nodes and group
  the domain codes to their
  respective grades. I want to
  check if any of them have at
  least two adjacent grades. I'll
  also need to verify the full
  path. This means finding a
  subject node that connects to a
  grade child, then a domain
  child, and finally a standard
  child while ensuring the type
  checks out. Plus, I can rely on
  a validation script to check
  the hierarchy, though it might
  not verify the existence of a
  full path, but that seems
  implied.

• I need to read a file and
  validate the changes made in
  development. I should perform
  some tool calls like using
  'sed' to access the QA file,
  and then read the ticket and
  referenced files. After that,
  running test commands seems
  necessary. I'm wondering if I
  should use a plan for this, but
  maybe I can just take a
  straightforward approach with a
  single request. For now, I’ll
  focus on running 'sed' to read
  the QA file.

  └ Read qa_4d74fcf055.md

• This request feels similar to
  the previous one; it's the same
  ticket and tests. We just
  validated the data for that
  earlier request. Still, the
  requirement mentions that it’s
  possible to run commands again,
  so why not rerun it? It's quick
  and should be straightforward.
  I'll make sure to confirm the
  AC path and any meta
  information too. So, let's
  proceed with the validate:data
  command once more.

• I should mention doing a prior
  check and confirm the sample
  path metadata and progression
  using Python. It seems running
  this check is optional, but I
  think it’s good to include an
  AC check in the report. It’s a
  good practice to run it quickly
  just to ensure everything is
  accurate. Keeping tabs on the
  details could save us some
  trouble later! So, I’ll move
  forward with that.

• I’m focused on creating a
  report, starting with a clear
  first line. I should include a
  summary of the command run and
  its output while noting that
  there are no changes to report.
  Additionally, the QA file
  references the same ticket, so
  I’ll mention that without
  needing to read it again. Once
  I’ve crafted everything, I need
  to ensure that the marker is
  precise at the very end,
  including the QA report inside
  it. Let's get started!

• I need to read the QA file and
  run tests, which sounds
  crucial. I’m considering using
  parallel reads to speed things
  up. It could be efficient! I’ll
  probably need to use the
  shell_command for this process.
  Okay, so coordinating those
  reads and ensuring the tests
  are executed properly is
  definitely on my mind. I want
  to make sure everything runs
  smoothly to get accurate
  results. Let's see how this
  goes!

  for the new request file. I’ll
  read it, run the test command,
  and summarize the findings. It
  seems like it’s similar to the
  RESEARCH-2 repeating task, but
  I’ll still follow the
  instructions to read the file
  and output the markers. I’ll
  use the shell command for that
  and run the validate:data
  command. Even though I’ve done
  this multiple times, the
  instructions allow for another
  run. I'll also prepare the
  Korean report and finish it
  with the markers.

• I need to handle a new request which involves
  reading a QA file to verify development changes,
  determining if the output is OK or FAIL. The first
  line should start with either OK or FAIL, and the
  last marker block must match exactly what's in the
  file. I plan to read both the QA and ticket files,
  run necessary commands (likely validate:data), and
  ensure there's no duplication. I'll proceed using
  shell_command for reading files and execute
  everything in parallel.

• I realized that the parallel process read the wrong
  ticket file, RESEARCH-2A instead of RESEARCH-1. I
  need to switch to reading RESEARCH-1 along with the
  contract document. I plan to run validate:data and
  npm test as instructed. For RESEARCH-1, I'll use sed
  and check the contract document for essential
  sections, like type tables and ID rules with
  examples. I'll also run tests since earlier outputs
  show that the tests pass. We can do this
  efficiently!

  Clarifying requirements

  I see the user instruction states that the first
  line should say OK/FAIL, with the marker at the end.
  It doesn't specify needing the token inside the
  marker, which is different from what's required for
  earlier ticket RESEARCH-2A. For this request, I’ll
  run both validate:data and npm test as the Dev
  mentioned. I need to verify that the documentation
  modifications meet the acceptance criteria (AC).
  Reading RESEARCH-1 will help me understand those
  criteria better before inspecting the relevant
  document sections. I'll use rg to check section
  headers efficiently.

• I'm looking into the ticket AC requirements. I need
  to check if Dev updated the documentation and linked
  it properly. The QA file mentions changes to the
  contract doc and ticket RESEARCH-1, so I’ll open
  that to see if it includes the link to the Single
  Source of Truth document. It should contain
  necessary components like a count of example IDs (at
  least 10), validation rules with examples, and a
  mapping table. The document lists 12 items, which is
  promising so far!

  Checking rule requirements

  The AC mentions each rule should include examples,
  likely for major ones. I can do a quick check in
  section 5, where E1-E7 and W1 are listed with
  success/fail code blocks. W1 has a definition but
  might lack an example; I've got to make sure it has
  one. I'll search for "#### W1" to verify, and also
  check for "성공:" after each header, though that
  might be a bit too strict. The mapping table should
  be present, and I’ll prepare a QA report in Korean
  indicating OK since the tests pass.

  Reviewing test warnings and markers

  I need to note the warnings from the npm test
  regarding React Router's future flag and act
  warnings, but since the tests pass, they’re non-
  blocking. There’s a requirement that the last output
  must have specific markers. I’ll make sure to print
  the marker at the end, like ###BEGIN:eb0358d671###,
  while also including the report body inside. I
  should quickly check the W sections for examples, as
  missing ones might lead to a fail, but they’re
  likely acceptable. I'll use a shell command for
  efficiency!

• I need to confirm the count of examples for AC2,
  which should be 12. I can say "예시 12개" to
  indicate that. To be accurate, I'll compute the
  count using a script since I previously noted there
  were 12 items. Running a quick Python script sounds
  like a good option to count the IDs in the example
  section. Alternatively, I could use shell commands
  to count lines starting with '-' until I hit a blank
  line. I'll proceed with this approach!

• I'm considering including specific sections and
  their counts. I also want to mention any warnings
  from tests, but I’ll treat those as non-blocking for
  now. Additionally, I need to note that I didn't
  execute npm run dev due to it requiring interactive
  input. I've got to make sure to include those
  specific markers exactly as mentioned. It's
  essential to keep everything organized and clear for
  future reference!

• I need to handle a new request by reading the QA
  file and ticket file, and then running test
  commands. The output should indicate whether it's OK
  or FAIL and include a marker block at the end with
  exact marker lines. I wonder if there's a rule about
  having the first line inside the marker be
  exclusively OK or FAIL. I’ll read the files using
  tools and proceed with multi_tool_use.parallel to
  handle the QA request efficiently.

• I'm looking to verify the RESEARCH-1 results. It
  seems we can either rerun the validate:data and npm
  test again, or we can reuse previous results because
  the rules allow for rerunning if necessary. I’ll
  make sure the documentation has the right sections
  and the correct example counts too. By the way, I’ll
  run the commands in parallel with
  multi_tool_use.parallel since that seems most
  efficient!

• I need to read a file and
  validate the changes made in
  development. I should perform
  some tool calls like using
  'sed' to access the QA file,
  and then read the ticket and
  referenced files. After that,
  running test commands seems
  necessary. I'm wondering if I
  should use a plan for this, but
  maybe I can just take a
  straightforward approach with a
  single request. For now, I’ll
  focus on running 'sed' to read
  the QA file.

• Explored
  └ Read qa_4d74fcf055.md

• This request feels similar to
  the previous one; it's the same
  ticket and tests. We just
  validated the data for that
  earlier request. Still, the
  requirement mentions that it’s
  possible to run commands again,
  so why not rerun it? It's quick
  and should be straightforward.
  I'll make sure to confirm the
  AC path and any meta
  information too. So, let's
  proceed with the validate:data
  command once more.

• Ran cd curriculum-viewer && npm
  │ run validate:data
  └
    > curriculum-viewer@0.0.0
    … +4 lines
    OK: curriculum_math_v1.json
    is valid

• I should mention doing a prior
  check and confirm the sample
  path metadata and progression
  using Python. It seems running
  this check is optional, but I
  think it’s good to include an
  AC check in the report. It’s a
  good practice to run it quickly
  just to ensure everything is
  accurate. Keeping tabs on the
  details could save us some
  trouble later! So, I’ll move
  forward with that.

    '2025-12-30'}

• I’m focused on creating a
  report, starting with a clear
  first line. I should include a
  summary of the command run and
  its output while noting that
  there are no changes to report.
  Additionally, the QA file
  references the same ticket, so
  I’ll mention that without
  needing to read it again. Once
  I’ve crafted everything, I need
  to ensure that the marker is
  precise at the very end,
  including the QA report inside
  it. Let's get started!

• I need to respond with OK/FAIL
  for the new request file. I’ll
  read it, run the test command,
  and summarize the findings. It
  seems like it’s similar to the
  RESEARCH-2 repeating task, but
  I’ll still follow the
  instructions to read the file
  and output the markers. I’ll
  use the shell command for that
  and run the validate:data
  command. Even though I’ve done
  this multiple times, the
  instructions allow for another
  run. I'll also prepare the
  Korean report and finish it
  with the markers.

• I need to handle a new request which involves
  reading a QA file to verify development changes,
  determining if the output is OK or FAIL. The first
  line should start with either OK or FAIL, and the
  last marker block must match exactly what's in the
  file. I plan to read both the QA and ticket files,
  run necessary commands (likely validate:data), and
  ensure there's no duplication. I'll proceed using
  shell_command for reading files and execute
  everything in parallel.

• I realized that the parallel process read the wrong
  ticket file, RESEARCH-2A instead of RESEARCH-1. I
  need to switch to reading RESEARCH-1 along with the
  contract document. I plan to run validate:data and
  npm test as instructed. For RESEARCH-1, I'll use sed
  and check the contract document for essential
  sections, like type tables and ID rules with
  examples. I'll also run tests since earlier outputs
  show that the tests pass. We can do this
  efficiently!

  Clarifying requirements

  I see the user instruction states that the first
  line should say OK/FAIL, with the marker at the end.
  It doesn't specify needing the token inside the
  marker, which is different from what's required for
  earlier ticket RESEARCH-2A. For this request, I’ll
  run both validate:data and npm test as the Dev
  mentioned. I need to verify that the documentation
  modifications meet the acceptance criteria (AC).
  Reading RESEARCH-1 will help me understand those
  criteria better before inspecting the relevant
  document sections. I'll use rg to check section
  headers efficiently.

• I'm looking into the ticket AC requirements. I need
  to check if Dev updated the documentation and linked
  it properly. The QA file mentions changes to the
  contract doc and ticket RESEARCH-1, so I’ll open
  that to see if it includes the link to the Single
  Source of Truth document. It should contain
  necessary components like a count of example IDs (at
  least 10), validation rules with examples, and a
  mapping table. The document lists 12 items, which is
  promising so far!

  Checking rule requirements

  The AC mentions each rule should include examples,
  likely for major ones. I can do a quick check in
  section 5, where E1-E7 and W1 are listed with
  success/fail code blocks. W1 has a definition but
  might lack an example; I've got to make sure it has
  one. I'll search for "#### W1" to verify, and also
  check for "성공:" after each header, though that
  might be a bit too strict. The mapping table should
  be present, and I’ll prepare a QA report in Korean
  indicating OK since the tests pass.

  Reviewing test warnings and markers

  I need to note the warnings from the npm test
  regarding React Router's future flag and act
  warnings, but since the tests pass, they’re non-
  blocking. There’s a requirement that the last output
  must have specific markers. I’ll make sure to print
  the marker at the end, like ###BEGIN:eb0358d671###,
  while also including the report body inside. I
  should quickly check the W sections for examples, as
  missing ones might lead to a fail, but they’re
  likely acceptable. I'll use a shell command for
  efficiency!

• I need to confirm the count of examples for AC2,
  which should be 12. I can say "예시 12개" to
  indicate that. To be accurate, I'll compute the
  count using a script since I previously noted there
  were 12 items. Running a quick Python script sounds
  like a good option to count the IDs in the example
  section. Alternatively, I could use shell commands
  to count lines starting with '-' until I hit a blank
  line. I'll proceed with this approach!

• I'm considering including specific sections and
  their counts. I also want to mention any warnings
  from tests, but I’ll treat those as non-blocking for
  now. Additionally, I need to note that I didn't
  execute npm run dev due to it requiring interactive
  input. I've got to make sure to include those
  specific markers exactly as mentioned. It's
  essential to keep everything organized and clear for
  future reference!

• I need to handle a new request by reading the QA
  file and ticket file, and then running test
  commands. The output should indicate whether it's OK
  or FAIL and include a marker block at the end with
  exact marker lines. I wonder if there's a rule about
  having the first line inside the marker be
  exclusively OK or FAIL. I’ll read the files using
  tools and proceed with multi_tool_use.parallel to
  handle the QA request efficiently.

• I'm looking to verify the RESEARCH-1 results. It
  seems we can either rerun the validate:data and npm
  test again, or we can reuse previous results because
  the rules allow for rerunning if necessary. I’ll
  make sure the documentation has the right sections
  and the correct example counts too. By the way, I’ll
  run the commands in parallel with
  multi_tool_use.parallel since that seems most
  efficient!

• I need to read the QA file and
  run tests, which sounds
  crucial. I’m considering using
  parallel reads to speed things
  up. It could be efficient! I’ll
  probably need to use the
  shell_command for this process.
  Okay, so coordinating those
  reads and ensuring the tests
  are executed properly is
  definitely on my mind. I want
  to make sure everything runs
  smoothly to get accurate
  results. Let's see how this
  goes!

• I need to respond with OK/FAIL
  for the new request file. I’ll
  read it, run the test command,
  and summarize the findings. It
  seems like it’s similar to the
  RESEARCH-2 repeating task, but
  I’ll still follow the
  instructions to read the file
  and output the markers. I’ll
  use the shell command for that
  and run the validate:data
  command. Even though I’ve done
  this multiple times, the
  instructions allow for another
  run. I'll also prepare the
  Korean report and finish it
  with the markers.

• I need to handle a new request which involves
  reading a QA file to verify development changes,
  determining if the output is OK or FAIL. The first
  line should start with either OK or FAIL, and the
  last marker block must match exactly what's in the
  file. I plan to read both the QA and ticket files,
  run necessary commands (likely validate:data), and
  ensure there's no duplication. I'll proceed using
  shell_command for reading files and execute
  everything in parallel.

• I realized that the parallel process read the wrong
  ticket file, RESEARCH-2A instead of RESEARCH-1. I
  need to switch to reading RESEARCH-1 along with the
  contract document. I plan to run validate:data and
  npm test as instructed. For RESEARCH-1, I'll use sed
  and check the contract document for essential
  sections, like type tables and ID rules with
  examples. I'll also run tests since earlier outputs
  show that the tests pass. We can do this
  efficiently!

  Clarifying requirements

  I see the user instruction states that the first
  line should say OK/FAIL, with the marker at the end.
  It doesn't specify needing the token inside the
  marker, which is different from what's required for
  earlier ticket RESEARCH-2A. For this request, I’ll
  run both validate:data and npm test as the Dev
  mentioned. I need to verify that the documentation
  modifications meet the acceptance criteria (AC).
  Reading RESEARCH-1 will help me understand those
  criteria better before inspecting the relevant
  document sections. I'll use rg to check section
  headers efficiently.

• I'm looking into the ticket AC requirements. I need
  to check if Dev updated the documentation and linked
  it properly. The QA file mentions changes to the
  contract doc and ticket RESEARCH-1, so I’ll open
  that to see if it includes the link to the Single
  Source of Truth document. It should contain
  necessary components like a count of example IDs (at
  least 10), validation rules with examples, and a
  mapping table. The document lists 12 items, which is
  promising so far!

  Checking rule requirements

  The AC mentions each rule should include examples,
  likely for major ones. I can do a quick check in
  section 5, where E1-E7 and W1 are listed with
  success/fail code blocks. W1 has a definition but
  might lack an example; I've got to make sure it has
  one. I'll search for "#### W1" to verify, and also
  check for "성공:" after each header, though that
  might be a bit too strict. The mapping table should
  be present, and I’ll prepare a QA report in Korean
  indicating OK since the tests pass.

  Reviewing test warnings and markers

  I need to note the warnings from the npm test
  regarding React Router's future flag and act
  warnings, but since the tests pass, they’re non-
  blocking. There’s a requirement that the last output
  must have specific markers. I’ll make sure to print
  the marker at the end, like ###BEGIN:eb0358d671###,
  while also including the report body inside. I
  should quickly check the W sections for examples, as
  missing ones might lead to a fail, but they’re
  likely acceptable. I'll use a shell command for
  efficiency!

• I need to confirm the count of examples for AC2,
  which should be 12. I can say "예시 12개" to
  indicate that. To be accurate, I'll compute the
  count using a script since I previously noted there
  were 12 items. Running a quick Python script sounds
  like a good option to count the IDs in the example
  section. Alternatively, I could use shell commands
  to count lines starting with '-' until I hit a blank
  line. I'll proceed with this approach!

• I'm considering including specific sections and
  their counts. I also want to mention any warnings
  from tests, but I’ll treat those as non-blocking for
  now. Additionally, I need to note that I didn't
  execute npm run dev due to it requiring interactive
  input. I've got to make sure to include those
  specific markers exactly as mentioned. It's
  essential to keep everything organized and clear for
  future reference!

• I need to handle a new request by reading the QA
  file and ticket file, and then running test
  commands. The output should indicate whether it's OK
  or FAIL and include a marker block at the end with
  exact marker lines. I wonder if there's a rule about
  having the first line inside the marker be
  exclusively OK or FAIL. I’ll read the files using
  tools and proceed with multi_tool_use.parallel to
  handle the QA request efficiently.

  seems we can either rerun the validate:data and npm
  test again, or we can reuse previous results because
  the rules allow for rerunning if necessary. I’ll
  make sure the documentation has the right sections
  and the correct example counts too. By the way, I’ll
  run the commands in parallel with
  multi_tool_use.parallel since that seems most
  efficient!

• I notice there are no tests for NodeDetail. I think
  we should mention that AC3 is existing behavior, not
  regression tested here. Since the build and tests
  are passing, I'm wondering if we should treat it as
  a fail. Nah, I think we can only verify it in the
  app, which is tricky. But it might be worthwhile to
  read the NodeDetail component to ensure it displays
  the necessary fields. I'll quickly inspect
  NodeDetail.

• I need to respond with OK/FAIL
  for the new request file. I’ll
  read it, run the test command,
  and summarize the findings. It
  seems like it’s similar to the
  RESEARCH-2 repeating task, but
  I’ll still follow the
  instructions to read the file
  and output the markers. I’ll
  use the shell command for that
  and run the validate:data
  command. Even though I’ve done
  this multiple times, the
  instructions allow for another
  run. I'll also prepare the
  Korean report and finish it
  with the markers.

• I need to handle a new request which involves
  reading a QA file to verify development changes,
  determining if the output is OK or FAIL. The first
  line should start with either OK or FAIL, and the
  last marker block must match exactly what's in the
  file. I plan to read both the QA and ticket files,
  run necessary commands (likely validate:data), and
  ensure there's no duplication. I'll proceed using
  shell_command for reading files and execute
  everything in parallel.

• I realized that the parallel process read the wrong
  ticket file, RESEARCH-2A instead of RESEARCH-1. I
  need to switch to reading RESEARCH-1 along with the
  contract document. I plan to run validate:data and
  npm test as instructed. For RESEARCH-1, I'll use sed
  and check the contract document for essential
  sections, like type tables and ID rules with
  examples. I'll also run tests since earlier outputs
  show that the tests pass. We can do this
  efficiently!

  Clarifying requirements

  I see the user instruction states that the first
  line should say OK/FAIL, with the marker at the end.
  It doesn't specify needing the token inside the
  marker, which is different from what's required for
  earlier ticket RESEARCH-2A. For this request, I’ll
  run both validate:data and npm test as the Dev
  mentioned. I need to verify that the documentation
  modifications meet the acceptance criteria (AC).
  Reading RESEARCH-1 will help me understand those
  criteria better before inspecting the relevant
  document sections. I'll use rg to check section
  headers efficiently.

• I'm looking into the ticket AC requirements. I need
  to check if Dev updated the documentation and linked
  it properly. The QA file mentions changes to the
  contract doc and ticket RESEARCH-1, so I’ll open
  that to see if it includes the link to the Single
  Source of Truth document. It should contain
  necessary components like a count of example IDs (at
  least 10), validation rules with examples, and a
  mapping table. The document lists 12 items, which is
  promising so far!

  Checking rule requirements

  The AC mentions each rule should include examples,
  likely for major ones. I can do a quick check in
  section 5, where E1-E7 and W1 are listed with
  success/fail code blocks. W1 has a definition but
  might lack an example; I've got to make sure it has
  one. I'll search for "#### W1" to verify, and also
  check for "성공:" after each header, though that
  might be a bit too strict. The mapping table should
  be present, and I’ll prepare a QA report in Korean
  indicating OK since the tests pass.

  Reviewing test warnings and markers

  I need to note the warnings from the npm test
  regarding React Router's future flag and act
  warnings, but since the tests pass, they’re non-
  blocking. There’s a requirement that the last output
  must have specific markers. I’ll make sure to print
  the marker at the end, like ###BEGIN:eb0358d671###,
  while also including the report body inside. I
  should quickly check the W sections for examples, as
  missing ones might lead to a fail, but they’re
  likely acceptable. I'll use a shell command for
  efficiency!

• I need to confirm the count of examples for AC2,
  which should be 12. I can say "예시 12개" to
  indicate that. To be accurate, I'll compute the
  count using a script since I previously noted there
  were 12 items. Running a quick Python script sounds
  like a good option to count the IDs in the example
  section. Alternatively, I could use shell commands
  to count lines starting with '-' until I hit a blank
  line. I'll proceed with this approach!

  their counts. I also want to mention any warnings
  from tests, but I’ll treat those as non-blocking for
  now. Additionally, I need to note that I didn't
  execute npm run dev due to it requiring interactive
  input. I've got to make sure to include those
  specific markers exactly as mentioned. It's
  essential to keep everything organized and clear for
  future reference!

• I need to handle a new request by reading the QA
  file and ticket file, and then running test
  commands. The output should indicate whether it's OK
  or FAIL and include a marker block at the end with
  exact marker lines. I wonder if there's a rule about
  having the first line inside the marker be
  exclusively OK or FAIL. I’ll read the files using
  tools and proceed with multi_tool_use.parallel to
  handle the QA request efficiently.

• I'm looking to verify the RESEARCH-1 results. It
  seems we can either rerun the validate:data and npm
  test again, or we can reuse previous results because
  the rules allow for rerunning if necessary. I’ll
  make sure the documentation has the right sections
  and the correct example counts too. By the way, I’ll
  run the commands in parallel with
  multi_tool_use.parallel since that seems most
  efficient!

  we should mention that AC3 is existing behavior, not
  regression tested here. Since the build and tests
  are passing, I'm wondering if we should treat it as
  a fail. Nah, I think we can only verify it in the
  app, which is tricky. But it might be worthwhile to
  read the NodeDetail component to ensure it displays
  the necessary fields. I'll quickly inspect
  NodeDetail.

  again, as per our rules, but it's already been done
  in a previous request. Ideally, it makes sense to
  rerun, even if it takes around 30 seconds, so I'll
  execute both in parallel. I need to confirm the AC1
  file paths, particularly for src/routes.ts, and
  check if those files exist. I'll also quickly look
  at the relevant files using rg, while keeping ticket
  FE-1 in mind.

  the correct severity and code. Let’s open
  validateCore.js and validate.ts to review the

  I can quickly test this by creating a temporary JSON
  file in the specified directory. I need to ensure we
  don't leave behind any junk files, so using node -e
  might be better for safe file creation while
  verifying. I'll proceed with the shell command for
  writing.

    (subject) -> missing
    EXIT:1

• I’m looking at the QA request to verify if the
  development change is okay or failed. All acceptance
  criteria seem satisfied, with tests passing and the
  command line interface working. The sorting is
  deterministic across 12 cases, so that’s good. I
  need to produce a report starting with "OK,"
  summarizing tests, warnings, and run commands. I
  should mention the exit code behavior and include
  markers as specified. The changed files don’t need
  to be referenced unless helpful. I’ll remember those
  markers must be included correctly!

  Clarifying Output Structure

  I need to ensure that my final output includes both
  the "BEGIN" and "DONE" markers, along with the
  report body in between, just as the skeleton
  indicates. The first line should state "OK" or
  "FAIL," and I’ve confirmed it should be "OK." The
  final lines must include the markers exactly as
  instructed, including the exit code results and a
  summary of each command’s success or failure. While
  it's not strictly necessary to clean temporary
  files, I think it might be best to remove them for a
  cleaner workspace.

  Deciding on Temporary Files

  I’m contemplating whether to keep the temporary JSON
  files that QA uses, but I think it’s better to avoid
  committing them. We haven’t committed any changes
  yet, so I could delete these files to reduce
  clutter. Since it's beneficial to keep the workspace
  tidy, I’ll go ahead and remove those temp JSON
  files. A simple command to remove them should do the
  trick! Let’s proceed with that.

• I’m looking at the QA request to verify if the
  development change is okay or failed. All acceptance
  criteria seem satisfied, with tests passing and the
  command line interface working. The sorting is
  deterministic across 12 cases, so that’s good. I
  need to produce a report starting with "OK,"
  summarizing tests, warnings, and run commands. I
  should mention the exit code behavior and include
  markers as specified. The changed files don’t need
  to be referenced unless helpful. I’ll remember those
  markers must be included correctly!

  Clarifying Output Structure

  I need to ensure that my final output includes both
  the "BEGIN" and "DONE" markers, along with the
  report body in between, just as the skeleton
  indicates. The first line should state "OK" or
  "FAIL," and I’ve confirmed it should be "OK." The
  final lines must include the markers exactly as
  instructed, including the exit code results and a
  summary of each command’s success or failure. While
  it's not strictly necessary to clean temporary
  files, I think it might be best to remove them for a
  cleaner workspace.

  Deciding on Temporary Files

  I’m contemplating whether to keep the temporary JSON
  files that QA uses, but I think it’s better to avoid
  committing them. We haven’t committed any changes
  yet, so I could delete these files to reduce
  clutter. Since it's beneficial to keep the workspace
  tidy, I’ll go ahead and remove those temp JSON
  files. A simple command to remove them should do the
  trick! Let’s proceed with that.

• I need to verify the changes made for the request by
  reading relevant files, running tests, and
  validating data. I want to check new types and
  ensure that the deterministic ordering includes
  message tie-breaks. It seems some code has already
  changed from the previous request, and the dev has
  mentioned new changes for defensive programming
  against unnormalized input. I'll need to inspect the
  repo for these updates and run the necessary tests
  while also creating malformed inputs to check for
  exceptions.

  Inspecting validateCore.js updates

  I need to take a look at the updates in
  validateCore.js, specifically to ensure that it can
  handle missing children_ids or parent_id gracefully.
  I’ll open the relevant files to examine the changes
  and probably use a parallel read approach to make
  this efficient. This way, I can quickly gather the
  necessary information and verify that the updates
  align with the requirements for error handling.
  Let's get started on this!

• I'm looking into a parallel call that has an invalid
  "ls" command with a Korean character, which I
  mistakenly typed as "ls -ლა". I've fixed that now.
  The outputs for "rg" and others are ready. There's
  an export for validateTypes, and the test message in
  validate.test has been updated. Now, it imports
  sortCurriculumIssues from validateCore.js, so that
  function should exist. I'll need to check
  validateCore.js to confirm the function is present
  since it was missing before.

• I’m considering whether we should check this in QA.
  It seems the repository might not run tsc, but there
  could still be hidden issues. A developer changed
  types to remove casts, which might result in
  TypeScript errors if someone runs tsc --noEmit. It’s
  not mentioned in the acceptance criteria, but it
  could be worth flagging. I’m wondering if I should
  run npm run build or npm run typecheck to be safe.
  Let's check the package.json for available scripts.

• I'm considering whether to run npm run build. It
  might take some time, but it could help catch
  TypeScript errors. The user only asked to validate
  development changes, but running the build seems
  relevant due to type changes. I'll navigate to the
  curriculum-viewer directory and start the build
  process to ensure there are no TypeScript errors. It
  seems like this will write to the dist folder, which
  already exists, but that’s allowed. Although it may
  take a bit longer, I think it's worth it. Let's run
  it!

    TS2304: Cannot find name 'CurriculumIssue'.

• As expected, the build fails due to a missing
  import, which is significant because the developer's
  changes aren't fully correct. While the ticket's
  acceptance criteria doesn't mention the build, it
  impacts the development workflow. I usually would
  mark this as FAIL since a broken build indicates a
  regression. The developer didn’t mention this issue,
  and we executed an extra command. I'll mark FAIL,
  providing steps to reproduce and the fix needed to
  resolve the CurriculumIssue type error.

  Testing validateCore functionality

  I want to make sure validateCore’s runtime defense
  is solid, so we could test it quickly with Node, but
  it isn’t necessary at the moment. We should,
  however, verify that validate-data still works. I'll
  run the validate:data commands, both the base and
  with the --file option. I might also consider
  creating a node command to check defensively.
  Despite that, we can still mention any passes for
  the FAIL context. Let's go ahead and run
  validate:data!

  there are warnings related to act and React Router.
  They don't seem severe since they don’t cause a
  failure. I'll need to run validate:data next to
  ensure everything is in order. It's a bit of a mix,
  but overall, the passing tests mean I’m likely on
  the right track, even if there's a little fine-
  tuning needed with those warnings.

  default file to ensure everything works smoothly.
  I’ll quickly open the script to find that default
  variable and figure this out.

• I need to check the deterministic sorting and codes

  I've already done some validation tests, it's a good
  idea to inspect the validateCore.js file to confirm
  it includes all necessary codes. I should rely on
  the tests and sample output too. It’s important to
  verify that validateCurriculum returns issues with
  the correct severity and code. Let’s open
  validateCore.js and validate.ts to review the
  sorting implementation quickly!

  I can quickly test this by creating a temporary JSON

  don't leave behind any junk files, so using node -e
  might be better for safe file creation while
  verifying. I'll proceed with the shell command for

• I’m looking at the QA request to verify if the
  development change is okay or failed. All acceptance
  criteria seem satisfied, with tests passing and the
  command line interface working. The sorting is
  deterministic across 12 cases, so that’s good. I
  need to produce a report starting with "OK,"
  summarizing tests, warnings, and run commands. I
  should mention the exit code behavior and include
  markers as specified. The changed files don’t need
  to be referenced unless helpful. I’ll remember those
  markers must be included correctly!

  Clarifying Output Structure

  I need to ensure that my final output includes both
  the "BEGIN" and "DONE" markers, along with the
  report body in between, just as the skeleton
  indicates. The first line should state "OK" or
  "FAIL," and I’ve confirmed it should be "OK." The
  final lines must include the markers exactly as
  instructed, including the exit code results and a
  summary of each command’s success or failure. While
  it's not strictly necessary to clean temporary
  files, I think it might be best to remove them for a
  cleaner workspace.

  Deciding on Temporary Files

  I’m contemplating whether to keep the temporary JSON
  files that QA uses, but I think it’s better to avoid
  committing them. We haven’t committed any changes
  yet, so I could delete these files to reduce
  clutter. Since it's beneficial to keep the workspace
  tidy, I’ll go ahead and remove those temp JSON
  files. A simple command to remove them should do the
  trick! Let’s proceed with that.

• I need to verify the changes made for the request by
  reading relevant files, running tests, and
  validating data. I want to check new types and
  ensure that the deterministic ordering includes
  message tie-breaks. It seems some code has already
  changed from the previous request, and the dev has
  mentioned new changes for defensive programming
  against unnormalized input. I'll need to inspect the
  repo for these updates and run the necessary tests
  while also creating malformed inputs to check for
  exceptions.

  Inspecting validateCore.js updates

  I need to take a look at the updates in
  validateCore.js, specifically to ensure that it can
  handle missing children_ids or parent_id gracefully.
  I’ll open the relevant files to examine the changes
  and probably use a parallel read approach to make
  this efficient. This way, I can quickly gather the
  necessary information and verify that the updates
  align with the requirements for error handling.
  Let's get started on this!

• I'm looking into a parallel call that has an invalid
  "ls" command with a Korean character, which I
  mistakenly typed as "ls -ლა". I've fixed that now.
  The outputs for "rg" and others are ready. There's
  an export for validateTypes, and the test message in
  validate.test has been updated. Now, it imports
  sortCurriculumIssues from validateCore.js, so that
  function should exist. I'll need to check
  validateCore.js to confirm the function is present
  since it was missing before.

• I’m considering whether we should check this in QA.
  It seems the repository might not run tsc, but there
  could still be hidden issues. A developer changed
  types to remove casts, which might result in
  TypeScript errors if someone runs tsc --noEmit. It’s
  not mentioned in the acceptance criteria, but it
  could be worth flagging. I’m wondering if I should
  run npm run build or npm run typecheck to be safe.
  Let's check the package.json for available scripts.

• I'm considering whether to run npm run build. It
  might take some time, but it could help catch
  TypeScript errors. The user only asked to validate
  development changes, but running the build seems
  relevant due to type changes. I'll navigate to the
  curriculum-viewer directory and start the build
  process to ensure there are no TypeScript errors. It
  seems like this will write to the dist folder, which
  already exists, but that’s allowed. Although it may
  take a bit longer, I think it's worth it. Let's run
  it!

    src/lib/curriculum/validate.ts(6,75): error
    TS2304: Cannot find name 'CurriculumIssue'.

• As expected, the build fails due to a missing
  import, which is significant because the developer's
  changes aren't fully correct. While the ticket's
  acceptance criteria doesn't mention the build, it
  impacts the development workflow. I usually would
  mark this as FAIL since a broken build indicates a
  regression. The developer didn’t mention this issue,
  and we executed an extra command. I'll mark FAIL,
  providing steps to reproduce and the fix needed to
  resolve the CurriculumIssue type error.

  Testing validateCore functionality

  I want to make sure validateCore’s runtime defense
  is solid, so we could test it quickly with Node, but
  it isn’t necessary at the moment. We should,
  however, verify that validate-data still works. I'll
  run the validate:data commands, both the base and
  with the --file option. I might also consider
  creating a node command to check defensively.
  Despite that, we can still mention any passes for
  the FAIL context. Let's go ahead and run
  validate:data!

  it includes all necessary codes. I should rely on

  the correct severity and code. Let’s open

• I'm thinking that the script should exit with a
  status of 0 but print any issues using stderr. If
  issues length is greater than 0, it should log to
  console.error and set the exit code to 1; otherwise,
  it remains 0.

  I can quickly test this by creating a temporary JSON
  file in the specified directory. I need to ensure we
  don't leave behind any junk files, so using node -e
  might be better for safe file creation while
  verifying. I'll proceed with the shell command for
  writing.

  Now, I'll move on to testing errors, aiming for an
  exit status of 1. I need to create a missing_child
  error file. Specifically, I'll generate a .tmp/
  qa_errors.json file that includes the subject
  children's IDs that are missing. After that, I’ll
  run it and check to confirm if it gives me the

• I’m looking at the QA request to verify if the
  development change is okay or failed. All acceptance
  criteria seem satisfied, with tests passing and the
  command line interface working. The sorting is
  deterministic across 12 cases, so that’s good. I
  need to produce a report starting with "OK,"
  summarizing tests, warnings, and run commands. I
  should mention the exit code behavior and include
  markers as specified. The changed files don’t need
  to be referenced unless helpful. I’ll remember those
  markers must be included correctly!

  Clarifying Output Structure

  I need to ensure that my final output includes both
  the "BEGIN" and "DONE" markers, along with the
  report body in between, just as the skeleton
  indicates. The first line should state "OK" or
  "FAIL," and I’ve confirmed it should be "OK." The
  final lines must include the markers exactly as
  instructed, including the exit code results and a
  summary of each command’s success or failure. While
  it's not strictly necessary to clean temporary
  files, I think it might be best to remove them for a
  cleaner workspace.

  Deciding on Temporary Files

  I’m contemplating whether to keep the temporary JSON
  files that QA uses, but I think it’s better to avoid
  committing them. We haven’t committed any changes
  yet, so I could delete these files to reduce
  clutter. Since it's beneficial to keep the workspace
  tidy, I’ll go ahead and remove those temp JSON
  files. A simple command to remove them should do the
  trick! Let’s proceed with that.

• I need to verify the changes made for the request by
  reading relevant files, running tests, and
  validating data. I want to check new types and
  ensure that the deterministic ordering includes
  message tie-breaks. It seems some code has already
  changed from the previous request, and the dev has
  mentioned new changes for defensive programming
  against unnormalized input. I'll need to inspect the
  repo for these updates and run the necessary tests
  while also creating malformed inputs to check for
  exceptions.

  Inspecting validateCore.js updates

  I need to take a look at the updates in
  validateCore.js, specifically to ensure that it can
  handle missing children_ids or parent_id gracefully.
  I’ll open the relevant files to examine the changes
  and probably use a parallel read approach to make
  this efficient. This way, I can quickly gather the
  necessary information and verify that the updates
  align with the requirements for error handling.
  Let's get started on this!

• I'm looking into a parallel call that has an invalid

  mistakenly typed as "ls -ლა". I've fixed that now.
  The outputs for "rg" and others are ready. There's
  an export for validateTypes, and the test message in
  validate.test has been updated. Now, it imports
  sortCurriculumIssues from validateCore.js, so that
  function should exist. I'll need to check
  validateCore.js to confirm the function is present
  since it was missing before.

• I’m considering whether we should check this in QA.
  It seems the repository might not run tsc, but there
  could still be hidden issues. A developer changed
  types to remove casts, which might result in
  TypeScript errors if someone runs tsc --noEmit. It’s
  not mentioned in the acceptance criteria, but it
  could be worth flagging. I’m wondering if I should
  run npm run build or npm run typecheck to be safe.
  Let's check the package.json for available scripts.

• I'm considering whether to run npm run build. It
  might take some time, but it could help catch
  TypeScript errors. The user only asked to validate
  development changes, but running the build seems
  relevant due to type changes. I'll navigate to the
  curriculum-viewer directory and start the build
  process to ensure there are no TypeScript errors. It
  seems like this will write to the dist folder, which
  already exists, but that’s allowed. Although it may
  take a bit longer, I think it's worth it. Let's run
  it!

• As expected, the build fails due to a missing
  import, which is significant because the developer's
  changes aren't fully correct. While the ticket's
  acceptance criteria doesn't mention the build, it
  impacts the development workflow. I usually would
  mark this as FAIL since a broken build indicates a
  regression. The developer didn’t mention this issue,
  and we executed an extra command. I'll mark FAIL,
  providing steps to reproduce and the fix needed to
  resolve the CurriculumIssue type error.

  Testing validateCore functionality

  I want to make sure validateCore’s runtime defense
  is solid, so we could test it quickly with Node, but
  it isn’t necessary at the moment. We should,
  however, verify that validate-data still works. I'll
  run the validate:data commands, both the base and
  with the --file option. I might also consider
  creating a node command to check defensively.
  Despite that, we can still mention any passes for
  the FAIL context. Let's go ahead and run
  validate:data!

• I need to verify if the Makefile exists and whether
  make verify works properly. I'll start by opening
  the Makefile and running the command. The dev
  specifically wants make verify, but I might also try
  rerunning validate:data with the --file option to
  make sure everything's in order. I’ll follow the
  tests accordingly. I also need to ensure make is
  using the correct current working directory, so I’ll
  check everything in the root directory. Let's
  inspect the file and proceed with the execution!

• I need to run make verify before finalizing. I might
  also check with cd curriculum-viewer && npm run

  with a missing file using --file doesnotexist to see
  if we get the expected error message. The ticket
  mentions existing error handling, so this should
  help keep risks low. I’ll run the validation
  commands carefully, ensuring not to create any new

• I need to read the ticket FE-2A.md and evaluate the
  changes. It’s essential to run some tests if
  possible, using npm commands like make verify. I
  should check the environment; running a
  shell_command could help. The network is enabled,
  but I might need to run npm install first. Let's
  create a plan that includes reading the ticket,
  inspecting changes, and running tests, before using
  update_plan to organize everything.

• I need to check for code modifications, so I'll
  start by inspecting the files. Running tests might
  help, but verifying the code is also important. I'll
  quickly open key files like Makefile, validate-
  data.mjs, and validateCore.js. Using a tool like rg
  could be useful. I think I should also consider
  running git diff. Since there's no information about
  branches, I'll use git status to check
  modifications. Reading through using shell_command
  will be the next step.

• I'm looking into how the validator returns sorted
  issues. I need to check the validate-data.mjs file,
  which reads a file, parses JSON, and performs schema
  validation. It sets an exit code of 1 for any file
  read, parse, or schema errors, and I want to make
  sure the CLI uses the core validator. It has a
  --file argument, and I need to confirm that the
  default file path is projectRoot/public/data/
  curriculum_math_v1.json. I’ll need to ensure that
  the file exists.

• Alright, I'm planning to run some commands in order
  and capture their outputs and exit codes. I think
  I’ll use bash -lc, but since shell_command uses the
  default shell, I need to consider using set -e for
  error handling. Validating data involves running
  npm run validate:data in the curriculum-viewer and
  checking the file path for curriculum_math_v1.json.
  After that, I’ll test with both an existing and a
  nonexistent file path, and perhaps create a
  temporary broken JSON file to test error handling.

  Planning test execution

  I’m organizing the tests carefully and want to
  verify the output like "OK: curriculum data is
  valid" along with the exit code. I plan to capture
  the exit status using echo $? after each run.
  Running commands in bash will be key, so I’ll use
  printf with cd curriculum-viewer && npm run
  validate:data; echo "exit:$?". However, I don’t
  want to stop on failures for negative tests. Using
  set -e will stop commands, but I might use || true
  to continue. Output management is crucial since it
  can be large. I’ll focus on capturing essential
  lines and summaries in the logs.

  Managing output capture

  I want to capture output without letting it get too
  large, so I’m considering using --silent, though it

• It seems there are errors because the tests rely on
  properties that don't exist, likely due to older
  API usage. We could either update the tests for the
  new API or revert the provider to the old version.
  The acceptance criteria say the build should pass,
  but if the tests fail, should we exclude them? They
  might actually belong to a different ticket and
  could be causing the whole suite to fail. However,
  since the user requested to verify Dev changes for
  FE-2A based on the delivered content, we may need
  to address the tests even if they're from another

  I think our report should indicate a FAIL since
  both npm test and npm run build are failing. We
  also need to verify that the validate-data script
  is using path resolution correctly. When running
  npm run validate:data -- --file public/data/
  curriculum_math_v1.json, the fileArg should resolve

• Alright, the other developer changed the file list,
  including validate.ts, which we need to confirm.
  The tests for validate.ts passed, so the CLI
  changes look good! I’m wondering if there’s
  something related to the .gitignore, but maybe
  that's not necessary to check right now.

      - 관찰: 테스트 코드가 기대하는
        CurriculumProvider API(export/props) 불일치로

  ## 원인 추정

  - curriculum-viewer/src/lib/curriculum/
    CurriculumProvider.tsx가 현재 { children }만 받으
    며, 테스트가 기대하는 autoLoad, loader props 및
    defaultCurriculumLoader export가 구현되어 있지 않

    조기 return 처리하여(현재 코드 기준) 테스트가 기
    대하는 “로딩 상태/에러 표시” 플로우가 실행되지 않
    음.

  ## 수정 제안(Dev가 바로 조치 가능하게)

  - 방향 A(권장): CurriculumProvider를 테스트 기대와
    맞추기
      - defaultCurriculumLoader를 export로 추가(기본
        fetch 로더)
      - CurriculumProvider props에 autoLoad?:
        boolean, loader?: ... 추가
      - 기본값은 테스트 환경에서 auto-load 비활성화하
        되(현 의도 유지), 테스트에서는 autoLoad로 강
        제 실행 가능하게 처리
  - 방향 B: 테스트를 현재 CurriculumProvider 구현에
    맞게 수정(loading/error 시나리오를 다른 방식으로
    검증)
  - 방향 C(보완): npm run build의 tsc -b 대상에서
    *.test.ts(x)를 제외하도록 tsconfig를 분리/조정
    (단, npm test 실패는 별도로 해결 필요)

  ## 참고(이번 FE-2A CLI 자체)

  - curriculum-viewer/scripts/validate-data.mjs 기반
    npm run validate:data는 기본 파일/--file/파일읽기
    실패/JSON 파싱 실패 시 명확한 stderr + non-zero
    종료를 충족했고, 샘플 데이터로 Exit 0 확인됨.

• GraphPage reads progress from localStorage on mount
  triggered by learningGraph or user changes, which
  should refresh state when navigating back via
  unmount/remount. The immediate update on localStorage
  change without navigation may not be handled but
  isn't strictly required given typical navigation
  flows; tests covering progress updates are noted for
  review.

  Planning deeper component and CSS review

  I'll check LearningNodeDetailPanel,
  LearningNodeLabel, LearningStatusLegend, and
  GraphPage for status mapping details and inspect
  index.css for related status styles.

• I'm confirming that the legend on GraphPage includes
  the learning status and uses progress data from the
  learning graph loaded via a specific loader and
  store. Next, I'll check the loader for local storage
  use and ensure map status refreshes correctly after
  returning from learning.

• Explored
  └ Read graph.ts

• GraphPage updates progress on mount by computing from
  storage, which matches the requirement that returning
  to the map triggers a fresh progress read, so no
  listener for localStorage changes is needed. I'll run
  the npm tests in curriculum-viewer to verify recent
  changes covering CurriculumGraphView and related
  tests.

  Verifying UI states and test coverage

  The implementation correctly handles button states
  and visual distinctions for node statuses, including
  locked opacity and status badges with legends on the
  map. Tests in CurriculumGraphView and
  LearningNodeDetailPanel cover these behaviors well,
  aligning with requirements. I'll run npm test again
  in curriculum-viewer to confirm everything passes.

• I've confirmed the map graph renders with a status
  overlay and badge matching the AC, including dimming
  for locked nodes and a legend component. The detail
  panel shows different buttons based on node status,
  aligning with the requirement that only AVAILABLE
  nodes have the "도전하기" button, while other
  statuses show variant labels.

  Preparing final QA report

  The analysis confirms all acceptance criteria mapped
  to code changes and existing tests. Tests ran
  successfully with 182 passing across 34 files,
  including new tests for graph overlays, navigation,
  and detail panels. Warnings about React Router future
  flags and act are noted but do not cause failures.
  Status refresh happens on page remount, satisfying
  the "immediate update" requirement on returning to
  map. Locked nodes display locked reasons correctly,
  and buttons reflect the correct status. Next is
  delivering the detailed QA report in the required
  marker block format.

• I'm weighing if tests count as documentation since no

  Confirming documentation gaps

  I found only planning-style content in task.md and

  documentation of rules, UI, or error messaging
  guidelines, indicating the documentation requirement
  is unmet.

• Explored
  └ Read AuthorEditorPage.tsx

• The existing code and test cases provide partial
  insight but lack formal documentation with examples
  as required, and the task.md file only contains a
  draft without explicit examples, suggesting the
  documentation requirement is unmet.

  Confirming missing formal spec documentation

  The existing task.md contains only draft definitions
  without examples or detailed UI/error specs, and no
  dedicated spec document was found, so documentation
  requirements remain unmet; running tests is optional
  but won't offset this primary failure.

• Explored
  └ Read task.md

• The task spec lacks concrete examples and clear error
  messaging guidelines, so I'll also check docs/
  quickstart.md for relevant preview usage to help
  cover missing details.

• The documentation for the feature is missing or
  incomplete, notably in task.md and the curriculum-
  viewer/docs folder. Reproduction steps will include
  opening task.md and searching docs to show no spec or
  explicit acceptance criteria details. Testing should
  be run via npm test in curriculum-viewer since that
  command is provided and encouraged by the rule.

  Running tests despite expected doc failure

  I'll run npm test in curriculum-viewer to comply with
  rules, expecting tests to pass; the main failure
  remains missing documentation.

• ReactFlow defaults to pan by dragging and zoom on
  scroll, matching Author Preview behavior with
  Controls and MiniMap. The current layout uses a 3-
  column grid fallback without dagre, so I'll search
  for existing dagre usage to meet the fallback auto-
  layout AC.

• Explored

• Discovered that the fallback graph layout uses dagre,
  but AuthorEditorPage relies on a grid layout instead.
  Next, I'll check SkillGraphPreview.tsx to see how the
  preview manages layouts and if it uses dagre.

• Explored
  └ Read SkillGraphPreview.tsx

• Investigating how AuthorEditor manages node layouts
  reveals it uses a manual grid fallback rather than
  dagre autop layout, which may violate the acceptance
  criteria. Next, I’ll inspect curriculumSync and
  mergeCurriculumIntoGraph to see if dagre-based
  layouts are applied during graph merging or import.

• Explored

• Noticed that without a draft, the curriculum metadata
  lacks layout, and the editor falls back to grid
  positioning instead of dagre, which risks failing the
  acceptance criteria that specify dagre layout
  explicitly. Next, I'll check the graphLayout function
  to see if it is used for computing positions
  elsewhere.

• AuthorEditor relies on grid layout, not dagre, so
  dagre might be unrelated to the main graph rendering;
  I'll verify by checking graphLayout usage in

• Explored
  └ Read graphRepository.ts, schema.ts

• The parser correctly ignores meta except for optional
  IDs and titles, satisfying meta-related acceptance
  criteria. The main open question is whether fallback
  to dagre auto layout is mandatory for QA, since
  acceptance criteria emphasize using positions when
  present and auto layout otherwise but only mention
  dagre explicitly in dev notes and TDD plans.

  Identifying layout reset mismatch

  The reset layout uses a grid fallback instead of the
  required dagre auto layout, likely causing a fail
  against acceptance criteria. Next, I'll run tests in
  the curriculum-viewer directory to confirm behavior

• The reset layout function writes grid-based positions
  instead of clearing them, conflicting with the spec

• The code prioritizes stored node positions in meta

• The fitView spy isn't called likely because focusNode
  relies on instanceRef set during onInit, but the
  test's asynchronous node state updates or data
  loading may delay or disrupt this linkage despite
  requestAnimationFrame being stubbed for immediate
  execution.

  Diagnosing test failure as ReactFlow nodes timing
  issue

  The test fails because focusNode returns early when
  the ReactFlow instance’s nodes are still empty at the
  time of list click, causing fitView not to be called;
  this likely stems from ReactFlow’s node state
  updating asynchronously after the graph loads, so
  focusNode triggers too soon before nodes mount in the
  test environment.

• The test fails because the focus function relies on
  nodes state, which may not be populated yet when the
  test triggers the click; this likely happens since
  nodes are asynchronously set after graph load but the
  test clicks the button too early. Next, I'll check
  timing or mock setup to ensure nodes state is
  populated before simulating the click.

  Diagnosing test timing and instance mismatch

  The test fails because the ReactFlow mock creates a
  new instance on each render, causing
  latestReactFlowInstance to differ from the instance
  used by the component's instanceRef, so the fitView
  spy checked by the test may not be called on the
  expected object. Additionally, asynchronous updates
  to nodes state and delayed instanceReady lead to
  tryFocusNode deferring focus indefinitely. Next, I'll
  suggest syncing instances in the mock and improving
  pending focus handling to fix the test.

• The connectable targets list is rendered after the
  heading only if there are connectable items, while a
  muted message appears if none are connectable.
  Because a React fragment wraps these conditionals,
  the heading's next sibling in the DOM might be the
  muted message or the list, affecting test targeting
  via heading.nextElementSibling.

  Reviewing cycle detection logic and edge validation

  Cycle detection skips simulating additions if the
  graph already has a cycle, which might allow invalid
  edges despite acceptance criteria requiring blocking
  cycles. The UI disables blocked nodes with reasons,
  consistent with error messages on clicks. The
  connectable targets list relies on candidate
  filtering from authorPreviewConnections, which uses
  cycle detection but may miss edge validations if the
  graph already contains cycles. Next, I'll run tests
  to verify behavior after these insights.

  Drafting detailed QA failure report

  I'm preparing a FAIL report that highlights the test
  failure due to mismatch in error message precedence
  for edge additions involving start nodes and cycles.
  The report will include reproduction steps, root
  cause analysis pointing to the current check order in
  the core logic, and fix suggestions to align either

  failure examples but note the reviewer report
  requirement is only in the ticket, not the doc.

  Clarifying reviewer report vs. QA output format

  I concluded the reviewer report rule requiring first
  non-empty line as APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES is from
  the ticket and distinct from the user-specified QA
  output format that mandates OK/FAIL first line. I'll
  comply with the OK/FAIL format for QA but mention the
  ticket's reviewer report rule in the evaluation.
  Next, I'll verify the sample data contains at least
  one valid subject→grade→domain→standard path using
  Python to parse and check children relationships.

  line rule conflicts with the QA output format using
  OK/FAIL. This inconsistency needs to be noted,
  clarifying the rule applies to review process, not
  the QA report itself.

  Confirming QA output resolution

  The plan is to follow the user-requested OK/FAIL
  output format while acknowledging the reviewer report
  rule applies to review process, not this QA report.
  I'll verify contract doc and sample data meet all
  requirements, run validation tests, and mention the
  reviewer rule conflict as a note without failing.
  Then I'll produce the final marker block with OK and

  Confirming documentation gaps

  I found only planning-style content in task.md and
  error messages/UI hints in code but no formal
  documentation of rules, UI, or error messaging
  guidelines, indicating the documentation requirement
  is unmet.

• Explored

• The existing code and test cases provide partial

  as required, and the task.md file only contains a
  draft without explicit examples, suggesting the
  documentation requirement is unmet.

  Confirming missing formal spec documentation

  The existing task.md contains only draft definitions
  without examples or detailed UI/error specs, and no
  dedicated spec document was found, so documentation
  requirements remain unmet; running tests is optional
  but won't offset this primary failure.

• ReactFlow defaults to pan by dragging and zoom on
  scroll, matching Author Preview behavior with
  Controls and MiniMap. The current layout uses a 3-

  for existing dagre usage to meet the fallback auto-
  layout AC.

• Explored
  └ Read SkillGraphPreview.tsx

• Investigating how AuthorEditor manages node layouts
  reveals it uses a manual grid fallback rather than
  dagre autop layout, which may violate the acceptance
  criteria. Next, I’ll inspect curriculumSync and
  mergeCurriculumIntoGraph to see if dagre-based
  layouts are applied during graph merging or import.

• Explored
  └ Read curriculumSync.ts

• Noticed that without a draft, the curriculum metadata
  lacks layout, and the editor falls back to grid
  positioning instead of dagre, which risks failing the
  acceptance criteria that specify dagre layout
  explicitly. Next, I'll check the graphLayout function
  to see if it is used for computing positions
  elsewhere.

• Explored
  └ Read graphLayout.ts

• AuthorEditor relies on grid layout, not dagre, so
  dagre might be unrelated to the main graph rendering;
  I'll verify by checking graphLayout usage in
  CurriculumGraphView and metadata in graphRepository
  and skillGraph/schema next.

• Explored
  └ Read graphRepository.ts, schema.ts

• The parser correctly ignores meta except for optional
  IDs and titles, satisfying meta-related acceptance
  criteria. The main open question is whether fallback
  to dagre auto layout is mandatory for QA, since
  acceptance criteria emphasize using positions when
  present and auto layout otherwise but only mention
  dagre explicitly in dev notes and TDD plans.

  Identifying layout reset mismatch

  The reset layout uses a grid fallback instead of the
  required dagre auto layout, likely causing a fail
  against acceptance criteria. Next, I'll run tests in
  the curriculum-viewer directory to confirm behavior
  and check for issues.

• The reset layout function writes grid-based positions
  instead of clearing them, conflicting with the spec
  that requires removing positions before auto layout.
  This likely causes the potential failure seen in
  tests and needs further verification for compliance.

• The code prioritizes stored node positions in meta

  overriding dagre. Reset layout replaces positions
  with dagre, effectively reinitializing layout.

• The fitView spy isn't called likely because focusNode
  relies on instanceRef set during onInit, but the
  test's asynchronous node state updates or data
  loading may delay or disrupt this linkage despite
  requestAnimationFrame being stubbed for immediate
  execution.

  Diagnosing test failure as ReactFlow nodes timing
  issue

  The test fails because focusNode returns early when
  the ReactFlow instance’s nodes are still empty at the
  time of list click, causing fitView not to be called;
  this likely stems from ReactFlow’s node state
  updating asynchronously after the graph loads, so
  focusNode triggers too soon before nodes mount in the
  test environment.

• The test fails because the focus function relies on
  nodes state, which may not be populated yet when the
  test triggers the click; this likely happens since
  nodes are asynchronously set after graph load but the
  test clicks the button too early. Next, I'll check
  timing or mock setup to ensure nodes state is
  populated before simulating the click.

  Diagnosing test timing and instance mismatch

  The test fails because the ReactFlow mock creates a
  new instance on each render, causing
  latestReactFlowInstance to differ from the instance
  used by the component's instanceRef, so the fitView
  spy checked by the test may not be called on the
  expected object. Additionally, asynchronous updates
  to nodes state and delayed instanceReady lead to
  tryFocusNode deferring focus indefinitely. Next, I'll
  suggest syncing instances in the mock and improving
  pending focus handling to fix the test.

• The connectable targets list is rendered after the
  heading only if there are connectable items, while a
  muted message appears if none are connectable.
  Because a React fragment wraps these conditionals,
  the heading's next sibling in the DOM might be the
  muted message or the list, affecting test targeting
  via heading.nextElementSibling.

  Reviewing cycle detection logic and edge validation

  Cycle detection skips simulating additions if the
  graph already has a cycle, which might allow invalid
  edges despite acceptance criteria requiring blocking
  cycles. The UI disables blocked nodes with reasons,
  consistent with error messages on clicks. The
  connectable targets list relies on candidate
  filtering from authorPreviewConnections, which uses
  cycle detection but may miss edge validations if the
  graph already contains cycles. Next, I'll run tests
  to verify behavior after these insights.

  Clarifying reviewer report vs. QA output format

  I concluded the reviewer report rule requiring first

  the ticket and distinct from the user-specified QA
  output format that mandates OK/FAIL first line. I'll
  comply with the OK/FAIL format for QA but mention the

  Confirming QA output resolution

  The plan is to follow the user-requested OK/FAIL
  output format while acknowledging the reviewer report
  rule applies to review process, not this QA report.
  I'll verify contract doc and sample data meet all

  Confirming missing formal spec documentation

  The existing task.md contains only draft definitions

  requirements remain unmet; running tests is optional

• ReactFlow defaults to pan by dragging and zoom on
  scroll, matching Author Preview behavior with
  Controls and MiniMap. The current layout uses a 3-
  column grid fallback without dagre, so I'll search
  for existing dagre usage to meet the fallback auto-
  layout AC.

• Explored
  └ Search dagre|layout|positions in curriculum-viewer

• Discovered that the fallback graph layout uses dagre,
  but AuthorEditorPage relies on a grid layout instead.
  Next, I'll check SkillGraphPreview.tsx to see how the
  preview manages layouts and if it uses dagre.

• Explored
  └ Read SkillGraphPreview.tsx

• Investigating how AuthorEditor manages node layouts
  reveals it uses a manual grid fallback rather than
  dagre autop layout, which may violate the acceptance
  criteria. Next, I’ll inspect curriculumSync and
  mergeCurriculumIntoGraph to see if dagre-based
  layouts are applied during graph merging or import.

• Explored
  └ Read curriculumSync.ts

• Noticed that without a draft, the curriculum metadata
  lacks layout, and the editor falls back to grid
  positioning instead of dagre, which risks failing the
  acceptance criteria that specify dagre layout
  explicitly. Next, I'll check the graphLayout function
  to see if it is used for computing positions
  elsewhere.

• Explored
  └ Read graphLayout.ts

• AuthorEditor relies on grid layout, not dagre, so
  dagre might be unrelated to the main graph rendering;
  I'll verify by checking graphLayout usage in
  CurriculumGraphView and metadata in graphRepository
  and skillGraph/schema next.

• Explored
  └ Read graphRepository.ts, schema.ts

• The parser correctly ignores meta except for optional
  IDs and titles, satisfying meta-related acceptance
  criteria. The main open question is whether fallback
  to dagre auto layout is mandatory for QA, since
  acceptance criteria emphasize using positions when
  present and auto layout otherwise but only mention
  dagre explicitly in dev notes and TDD plans.

  Identifying layout reset mismatch

  The reset layout uses a grid fallback instead of the
  required dagre auto layout, likely causing a fail
  against acceptance criteria. Next, I'll run tests in
  the curriculum-viewer directory to confirm behavior
  and check for issues.

• The reset layout function writes grid-based positions
  instead of clearing them, conflicting with the spec
  that requires removing positions before auto layout.
  This likely causes the potential failure seen in
  tests and needs further verification for compliance.

  FAIL
  요약: FE-2 요구사항의 “dagre 자동 배치 fallback/Reset
  Layout”이 구현되어 있지 않음(현재 고정 그리드 배치).
  재현 단계:

  1. Draft에서 meta.layout.positions를 제거(또는 신규
     유저로 시작)한다.
  2. cd curriculum-viewer && npm run dev 실행 후 Author
     Preview 진입.
  3. 노드가 3열 그리드로 배치되고 Reset Layout도 동일
     그리드로 재배치됨.
     증상/로그:

  - dagre 기반 자동 배치가 아닌 고정 그리드 좌표로 렌더
    링됨.
    원인 추정:
  - ensureLayoutPositions/resetLayoutPositions가 dagre
    호출 없이 그리드 좌표를 생성함 (curriculum-viewer/
    src/pages/AuthorEditorPage.tsx:99, curriculum-
    viewer/src/pages/AuthorEditorPage.tsx:123).
    수정 제안:
  - positions가 없을 때 dagre 기반 레이아웃을 계산하도
    록 수정(예: curriculum-viewer/src/lib/curriculum/
    graphLayout.ts 유사 로직 적용).
  - Reset Layout은 positions를 제거하거나 dagre 결과로
    재계산해 저장.
    테스트:
  - cd curriculum-viewer && npm test (pass). 경고:
    React Router future flags, act(...) warning 다수.

• The code prioritizes stored node positions in meta
  over dagre layout by merging with existing positions
  overriding dagre. Reset layout replaces positions
  with dagre, effectively reinitializing layout.
  Position data is meta-only, not impacting schema
  validation. Loading and persisting ensure positions
  exist, but it’s unclear if new nodes always get valid
  positions or fall back to a default grid.

• The fitView spy isn't called likely because focusNode
  relies on instanceRef set during onInit, but the
  test's asynchronous node state updates or data
  loading may delay or disrupt this linkage despite
  requestAnimationFrame being stubbed for immediate
  execution.

  Diagnosing test failure as ReactFlow nodes timing
  issue

  The test fails because focusNode returns early when
  the ReactFlow instance’s nodes are still empty at the
  time of list click, causing fitView not to be called;
  this likely stems from ReactFlow’s node state
  updating asynchronously after the graph loads, so
  focusNode triggers too soon before nodes mount in the
  test environment.

• The test fails because the focus function relies on
  nodes state, which may not be populated yet when the
  test triggers the click; this likely happens since
  nodes are asynchronously set after graph load but the
  test clicks the button too early. Next, I'll check
  timing or mock setup to ensure nodes state is
  populated before simulating the click.

  Diagnosing test timing and instance mismatch

  The test fails because the ReactFlow mock creates a
  new instance on each render, causing
  latestReactFlowInstance to differ from the instance
  used by the component's instanceRef, so the fitView
  spy checked by the test may not be called on the
  expected object. Additionally, asynchronous updates
  to nodes state and delayed instanceReady lead to
  tryFocusNode deferring focus indefinitely. Next, I'll
  suggest syncing instances in the mock and improving
  pending focus handling to fix the test.

• The connectable targets list is rendered after the

  muted message appears if none are connectable.
  Because a React fragment wraps these conditionals,
  the heading's next sibling in the DOM might be the
  muted message or the list, affecting test targeting
  via heading.nextElementSibling.

  Reviewing cycle detection logic and edge validation

  Cycle detection skips simulating additions if the
  graph already has a cycle, which might allow invalid
  edges despite acceptance criteria requiring blocking
  cycles. The UI disables blocked nodes with reasons,
  consistent with error messages on clicks. The
  connectable targets list relies on candidate
  filtering from authorPreviewConnections, which uses
  cycle detection but may miss edge validations if the
  graph already contains cycles. Next, I'll run tests
  to verify behavior after these insights.

• There's a conflict between the QA requirement for the

  the marker must be APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES. I'll
  prioritize the QA requirement (OK/FAIL first line)
  and consider placing APPROVE/REQUEST_CHANGES
  immediately after.

  Prioritizing QA output format while verifying ticket
  rules

  I'll keep the marker block's first line as OK or FAIL
  per QA output requirements, while separately
  verifying and noting if the ticket’s reviewer report
  line rule (APPROVE/REQUEST_CHANGES first line) is met
  in the data. Next, I'll review the ticket, contract,

  requirement is only in the ticket, not the doc.

  Clarifying reviewer report vs. QA output format

  I concluded the reviewer report rule requiring first
  non-empty line as APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES is from
  the ticket and distinct from the user-specified QA
  output format that mandates OK/FAIL first line. I'll
  comply with the OK/FAIL format for QA but mention the
  ticket's reviewer report rule in the evaluation.
  Next, I'll verify the sample data contains at least
  one valid subject→grade→domain→standard path using
  Python to parse and check children relationships.

• The contract doc meets all schema and example
  requirements, but the ticket's reviewer report first-
  line rule conflicts with the QA output format using
  OK/FAIL. This inconsistency needs to be noted,
  clarifying the rule applies to review process, not
  the QA report itself.

  Confirming QA output resolution

  The plan is to follow the user-requested OK/FAIL
  output format while acknowledging the reviewer report
  rule applies to review process, not this QA report.
  I'll verify contract doc and sample data meet all
  requirements, run validation tests, and mention the
  reviewer rule conflict as a note without failing.
  Then I'll produce the final marker block with OK and
  a concise report.

============================================================
  files have definitions without explicit specs or UI
  error guidance. Next, I'll check UI code for implicit
  rules and decide if documentation gaps warrant QA
  failure.

  Confirming absence of required documentation

  No formal docs with examples or error messaging
  guidelines exist, so per acceptance criteria this
  warrants a fail. Next, I'm verifying inline UI
  messages in AuthorEditorPage but expecting these
  won't suffice as proper documentation.

• Only task.md includes definitions that might count as
  spec but lacks explicit examples; dev logs have
  examples but aren't stable docs. Considering tests
  for example coverage next to support the QA
  verification.

• Explored
  └ Read authorPreviewRules.test.ts

• I'm weighing if tests count as documentation since no
  explicit docs were added, and I'll verify existing
  docs and comments for rule specifications before
  concluding.

  Confirming documentation gaps

  I found only planning-style content in task.md and
  error messages/UI hints in code but no formal
  documentation of rules, UI, or error messaging
  guidelines, indicating the documentation requirement
  is unmet.

• Explored
  └ Read AuthorEditorPage.tsx

• The existing code and test cases provide partial
  insight but lack formal documentation with examples
  as required, and the task.md file only contains a
  draft without explicit examples, suggesting the
  documentation requirement is unmet.

  Confirming missing formal spec documentation

  The existing task.md contains only draft definitions
  without examples or detailed UI/error specs, and no
  dedicated spec document was found, so documentation
  requirements remain unmet; running tests is optional
  but won't offset this primary failure.

• Explored
  └ Read task.md

• The task spec lacks concrete examples and clear error
  messaging guidelines, so I'll also check docs/
  quickstart.md for relevant preview usage to help
  cover missing details.

• Explored
  └ Search Author Preview|Preview in quickstart.md

• The documentation for the feature is missing or
  incomplete, notably in task.md and the curriculum-
  viewer/docs folder. Reproduction steps will include
  opening task.md and searching docs to show no spec or
  explicit acceptance criteria details. Testing should
  be run via npm test in curriculum-viewer since that
  command is provided and encouraged by the rule.

  Running tests despite expected doc failure

  I'll run npm test in curriculum-viewer to comply with
  rules, expecting tests to pass; the main failure
  remains missing documentation.

• I'm outlining a failure report citing missing
  documentation for acceptance criteria, noting the
  candidate planning doc only has a draft with no
  examples or finalized schemas, and that no single
  source of truth doc exists in the repo. I'll
  reference specific file paths and line numbers,
  mention executed tests with warnings but no large
  logs, and end with a FAIL marker as required.

  Finalizing detailed failure report

  I've structured a clear Korean QA report indicating
  the documentation is incomplete per acceptance
  criteria, citing specific lines in the draft task doc
  for missing examples, schema, and UI guidelines. The
  report includes reproduction steps, symptoms with
  precise file/line references, test results with
  warnings, root cause as missing SSoT doc, and fix
  suggestions with numbered actionable points, all
  wrapped in the required marker block starting with
  FAIL.

• ReactFlow defaults to pan by dragging and zoom on
  scroll, matching Author Preview behavior with
  Controls and MiniMap. The current layout uses a 3-
  column grid fallback without dagre, so I'll search
  for existing dagre usage to meet the fallback auto-
  layout AC.

• Explored

• Discovered that the fallback graph layout uses dagre,
  but AuthorEditorPage relies on a grid layout instead.
  Next, I'll check SkillGraphPreview.tsx to see how the
  preview manages layouts and if it uses dagre.

• Explored
  └ Read SkillGraphPreview.tsx

• Investigating how AuthorEditor manages node layouts
  reveals it uses a manual grid fallback rather than
  dagre autop layout, which may violate the acceptance
  criteria. Next, I’ll inspect curriculumSync and
  mergeCurriculumIntoGraph to see if dagre-based
  layouts are applied during graph merging or import.

• Explored
  └ Read curriculumSync.ts

• Noticed that without a draft, the curriculum metadata
  lacks layout, and the editor falls back to grid
  positioning instead of dagre, which risks failing the
  acceptance criteria that specify dagre layout
  explicitly. Next, I'll check the graphLayout function
  to see if it is used for computing positions
  elsewhere.

• Explored
  └ Read graphLayout.ts

• AuthorEditor relies on grid layout, not dagre, so
  dagre might be unrelated to the main graph rendering;
  I'll verify by checking graphLayout usage in
  CurriculumGraphView and metadata in graphRepository
  and skillGraph/schema next.

• Explored
  └ Read graphRepository.ts, schema.ts

• The parser correctly ignores meta except for optional
  IDs and titles, satisfying meta-related acceptance
  criteria. The main open question is whether fallback
  to dagre auto layout is mandatory for QA, since
  acceptance criteria emphasize using positions when
  present and auto layout otherwise but only mention
  dagre explicitly in dev notes and TDD plans.

  Identifying layout reset mismatch

  The reset layout uses a grid fallback instead of the
  required dagre auto layout, likely causing a fail
  against acceptance criteria. Next, I'll run tests in
  the curriculum-viewer directory to confirm behavior
  and check for issues.

• The reset layout function writes grid-based positions
  instead of clearing them, conflicting with the spec

  This likely causes the potential failure seen in

• The code prioritizes stored node positions in meta
  over dagre layout by merging with existing positions
  overriding dagre. Reset layout replaces positions
  with dagre, effectively reinitializing layout.
  Position data is meta-only, not impacting schema
  validation. Loading and persisting ensure positions
  exist, but it’s unclear if new nodes always get valid
  positions or fall back to a default grid.

• The fitView spy isn't called likely because focusNode
  relies on instanceRef set during onInit, but the
  test's asynchronous node state updates or data
  loading may delay or disrupt this linkage despite
  requestAnimationFrame being stubbed for immediate
  execution.

  Diagnosing test failure as ReactFlow nodes timing
  issue

  The test fails because focusNode returns early when
  the ReactFlow instance’s nodes are still empty at the
  time of list click, causing fitView not to be called;
  this likely stems from ReactFlow’s node state
  updating asynchronously after the graph loads, so
  focusNode triggers too soon before nodes mount in the
  test environment.

• The test fails because the focus function relies on
  nodes state, which may not be populated yet when the
  test triggers the click; this likely happens since
  nodes are asynchronously set after graph load but the
  test clicks the button too early. Next, I'll check
  timing or mock setup to ensure nodes state is
  populated before simulating the click.

  Diagnosing test timing and instance mismatch

  The test fails because the ReactFlow mock creates a
  new instance on each render, causing
  latestReactFlowInstance to differ from the instance
  used by the component's instanceRef, so the fitView
  spy checked by the test may not be called on the
  expected object. Additionally, asynchronous updates
  to nodes state and delayed instanceReady lead to
  tryFocusNode deferring focus indefinitely. Next, I'll
  suggest syncing instances in the mock and improving
  pending focus handling to fix the test.

• The connectable targets list is rendered after the
  heading only if there are connectable items, while a
  muted message appears if none are connectable.
  Because a React fragment wraps these conditionals,
  the heading's next sibling in the DOM might be the
  muted message or the list, affecting test targeting
  via heading.nextElementSibling.

  Reviewing cycle detection logic and edge validation

  Cycle detection skips simulating additions if the
  graph already has a cycle, which might allow invalid
  edges despite acceptance criteria requiring blocking
  cycles. The UI disables blocked nodes with reasons,
  consistent with error messages on clicks. The
  connectable targets list relies on candidate
  filtering from authorPreviewConnections, which uses
  cycle detection but may miss edge validations if the
  graph already contains cycles. Next, I'll run tests
  to verify behavior after these insights.

  requirement is only in the ticket, not the doc.

  Clarifying reviewer report vs. QA output format

  I concluded the reviewer report rule requiring first
  non-empty line as APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES is from
  the ticket and distinct from the user-specified QA
  output format that mandates OK/FAIL first line. I'll
  comply with the OK/FAIL format for QA but mention the
  ticket's reviewer report rule in the evaluation.
  Next, I'll verify the sample data contains at least
  one valid subject→grade→domain→standard path using
  Python to parse and check children relationships.

  Confirming QA output resolution

  The plan is to follow the user-requested OK/FAIL
  output format while acknowledging the reviewer report
  rule applies to review process, not this QA report.
  I'll verify contract doc and sample data meet all

• I'm assembling the final response with an OK marker
  and a concise summary of route verification, test
  results including warnings, and key observations
  about page components and layout references.

  Including loading/error UI notes

  I'll note that load and error states come from
  CurriculumProvider and are covered by existing tests
  but weren't manually verified, keeping the summary
  concise and within limits.

• I'm reviewing the focus management logic in
  useFocusNodeId and the overall layout and behavior of
  GraphPage to understand how focus is handled and how
  it might impact user interactions or UI updates.

• Explored
  └ Read useFocusNodeId.ts, GraphPage.tsx

• GraphPage sets focusNodeId in the URL on click,
  meeting accessibility criteria, but its tests don't
  verify URL focus handling explicitly. GraphView’s
  progression edges use a dashed style via
  getEdgeStyle, and layout depends on
  buildProgressionEdges and
  buildContainsEdgeRefsSkippingGradeNodes; next is
  confirming if buildProgressionEdges produces
  deterministic edge order.

• The layout uses dagre which is deterministic if input
  edge/node order is stable; since input data order
  seems stable, the layout should be deterministic but
  no explicit test exists. The current tests pass with
  warnings and QA deems this acceptable given no code
  changes affecting stability.
