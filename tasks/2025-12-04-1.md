# Task 2025-12-04-1 — Skill Tree UX Fix Follow-up

## Problem Summary
The prior attempt to deliver responsive Skill Tree improvements left the repo in a broken state and did not implement the planned UX changes:
- `app/routers/skills.py` and `tests/test_practice_plan.py` contain literal diff text instead of executable code, so the API/server cannot start and pytest fails immediately.
- No frontend work landed; the Skill Tree still has the same narrow viewport, overlapping tooltips, floating arrows, and the student dashboard remains disconnected.
- Because of the broken router file, even the new practice-plan endpoint does not run or integrate with the student flow, so none of the acceptance criteria were met.

## Objectives
1. Restore the codebase to a working state (revert the accidental diffs, ensure `/api/v1/skills/*` endpoints import correctly, tests run).
2. Re-implement the responsive Skill Tree layout and interaction fixes per the spec:
   - Auto-fit viewport on load, responsive widths, detail panel behavior.
   - Increased node spacing, collision-free tooltips/hover states, arrow rendering to node boundaries.
3. Unify the student dashboard with the Skill Tree practice flow (embed skill overview, skill-scoped practice CTA + confirmation modal, retire legacy S1/S2/S3 copy).
4. Ensure practice session launch accepts the selected skill/course step and surfaces metadata (prereqs, XP) to the UI.
5. Add regression tests covering the restored router, practice-plan endpoint (if kept), and visual/interaction changes where feasible.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `app/routers/skills.py` contains valid FastAPI router code; `/api/v1/skills/tree` and any new practice-plan endpoint work under pytest and manual smoke tests.
- `tests/test_practice_plan.py` (or equivalent) exists as valid Python and passes.
- Opening `/skills` shows the full Skill Tree auto-fitted to the viewport; tooltips never overlap neighboring nodes, and arrows terminate on node bodies.
- StudentDashboard displays the Skill Tree (or summary) and launches a skill-specific practice session via a confirmation modal; legacy S1/S2/S3 references are removed.
- Telemetry events for viewport fit, hover, and practice launch fire with expected payloads.
- QA evidence demonstrates desktop + mobile behavior, and the broken state (diff text in source files) is fully resolved.

## Risks & Notes
- Need to carefully restore files to avoid losing legitimate work; consider using `git restore` plus selective reapplication of intended changes.
- UX alignment still required for merged dashboard; coordinate with design before coding.
- Large change set: ensure incremental commits and reviewers for backend + frontend portions.
