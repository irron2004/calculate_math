  ## Review Result: REQUEST_CHANGES

  ### Summary

  R3 transfer output is present, but R1/R2 deliverables and QA/DAG
  validation are missing, so acceptance criteria and checklist items
  cannot be verified.

  ### Checklist Results

  | Category | Pass/Fail | Notes |
  |----------|-----------|-------|
  | Coverage (R1) | Fail | R1 coverage_gap_report and
  missing_prereq_patch not provided; cannot confirm 10+ missing, 5+
  overreach, 5+ risky jumps or standards tags/confidence. |
  | Progression (R2) | Fail | R2 micro/bridge/requires analysis not
  provided; cannot assess micro granularity or requires necessity. |
  | Transfer (R3) | Partial | Templates/triplets/edges provided; however
  no QA validation and some template specs have malformed formulas (line
  breaks) that need cleanup for generation. |
  | DAG Integrity | Fail | No cycle check or level constraints
  verification; cannot confirm requires-only locking or absence of
  cycles. |
  | Conflict Resolution | Fail | No R1/R2 patches provided, so no
  conflict resolution can be evaluated. |

  ### Issues Found (if REQUEST_CHANGES)

  | # | Severity | Issue | Affected Researcher | Suggested Fix |
  |---|----------|-------|--------------------|--------------|
  | 1 | Critical | Missing R1 outputs (coverage_gap_report,
  missing_prereq_patch with standards tags/confidence) against acceptance
  criteria | R1 | Provide R1 report and patch with 10+ missing prereqs,
  5+ overreach, 5+ risky jumps, and confidence for all proposals. |
  | 2 | Critical | Missing R2 outputs (progression analysis, bridge
  nodes, requires justification) | R2 | Provide R2 progression report and
  patch; include at least 10 blockage reasons and clear requires vs notes
  decisions. |
  | 3 | High | No QA report; checklist claims cannot be validated | R1/
  R2/R3 | Add QA validation results covering checklist items and data
  integrity. |
  | 4 | Medium | DAG integrity not verified (cycle/level/locking checks
  absent) | R1/R2/R3 | Provide explicit DAG checks and confirm no cycles
  and no manual level assignment. |
  | 5 | Medium | Template formulas contain broken lines (e.g., |A|+|B|-|
  A∩B|) which may break generation | R3 | Normalize formulas to single-
  line expressions and validate each template is executable. |

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - Deliver full R1/R2 patch JSONs and reports before merging; only then
    run conflict resolution rules.
  - Add a brief DAG audit section with explicit cycle checks and
    requires-only locking confirmation.
  - Normalize template math strings and re-run generation validation for
    each template.

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - Deliver complete R1/R2 patches before attempting merge or conflict
    resolution.
  - Include a short DAG audit section with explicit no-cycle
    confirmation.
  - Normalize template strings and validate each template is executable.

  ## Review Result: REQUEST_CHANGES

  ### Summary

  R3 transfer output is present, but R1/R2 deliverables and QA/DAG
  validation are missing, so acceptance criteria and checklist items
  cannot be verified.

  ### Checklist Results

  | Category | Pass/Fail | Notes |
  |----------|-----------|-------|
  | Coverage (R1) | Fail | R1 coverage_gap_report and
  missing_prereq_patch not provided; cannot confirm 10+ missing, 5+
  overreach, 5+ risky jumps or standards tags/confidence. |
  | Progression (R2) | Fail | R2 micro/bridge/requires analysis not
  provided; cannot assess micro granularity or requires necessity. |
  | Transfer (R3) | Partial | Templates/triplets/edges provided; however
  no QA validation and some template specs have malformed formulas (line
  breaks) that need cleanup for generation. |
  | DAG Integrity | Fail | No cycle check or level constraints
  verification; cannot confirm requires-only locking or absence of
  cycles. |
  | Conflict Resolution | Fail | No R1/R2 patches provided, so no
  conflict resolution can be evaluated. |

  ### Issues Found (if REQUEST_CHANGES)

  | # | Severity | Issue | Affected Researcher | Suggested Fix |
  |---|----------|-------|--------------------|--------------|
  | 1 | Critical | Missing R1 outputs (coverage_gap_report,
  missing_prereq_patch with standards tags/confidence) against acceptance
  criteria | R1 | Provide R1 report and patch with 10+ missing prereqs,
  5+ overreach, 5+ risky jumps, and confidence for all proposals. |
  | 2 | Critical | Missing R2 outputs (progression analysis, bridge
  nodes, requires justification) | R2 | Provide R2 progression report and
  patch; include at least 10 blockage reasons and clear requires vs notes
  decisions. |
  | 3 | High | No QA report; checklist claims cannot be validated | R1/
  R2/R3 | Add QA validation results covering checklist items and data
  integrity. |
  | 4 | Medium | DAG integrity not verified (cycle/level/locking checks
  absent) | R1/R2/R3 | Provide explicit DAG checks and confirm no cycles
  and no manual level assignment. |
  | 5 | Medium | Template formulas contain broken lines (e.g., |A|+|B|-|
  A∩B|) which may break generation | R3 | Normalize formulas to single-
  line expressions and validate each template is executable. |

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - Deliver full R1/R2 patch JSONs and reports before merging; only then
    run conflict resolution rules.
  - Add a brief DAG audit section with explicit cycle checks and
    requires-only locking confirmation.
  - Normalize template math strings and re-run generation validation for
    each template.

  ## Review Result: [REQUEST_CHANGES]

  ### Summary

  현재 reviewer 요청 파일에는 R3 산출물만 포함되어 R1/R2 패치 병합·충돌
  해결을 수행할 수 없고, QA/DAG 검증 섹션도 비어 있어 승인할 수 없습니다.
  또한 R3 Graph Patch JSON은 add_nodes/add_edges에 confidence(0~1)가 누락
  되어 공통 규칙을 위반합니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  | Category | Pass/Fail | Notes |
  |----------|-----------|-------|
  | Coverage (R1) | Fail | R1 coverage_gap_report 및 missing_prereq_patch
  가 본 파일에 포함되어 있지 않음 |
  | Progression (R2) | Fail | R2 progression report 및 prereq_patch가 본
  파일에 포함되어 있지 않음 |
  | Transfer (R3) | Fail | Graph Patch JSON의 add_nodes/add_edges에
  confidence 누락 + QA report 미제공 |
  | DAG Integrity | Fail | requires 사이클/레벨/잠금(requires-only) 검증
  결과 미제공 |
  | Conflict Resolution | Fail | R1/R2 패치 부재로 충돌 규칙 적용 불가 |

  ### Issues Found (if REQUEST_CHANGES)

  | # | Severity | Issue | Affected Researcher | Suggested Fix |
  |---|----------|-------|--------------------|--------------|
  | 1 | Critical | R1 산출물 누락(coverage report + Graph Patch JSON) |
  R1 / Packager | R1 최종 missing_prereq_patch를 reviewer 요청 파일에 포
  함 |
  | 2 | Critical | R2 산출물 누락(progression report + Graph Patch JSON)
  | R2 / Packager | R2 최종 prereq_patch를 reviewer 요청 파일에 포함 |
  | 3 | High | R3 Graph Patch JSON에 confidence 필드 누락(공통 규칙 위반)
  | R3 | add_nodes/add_edges에 confidence 추가(Transfer Edge Analysis 표
  의 confidence를 그대로 사용 가능) |
  | 4 | High | QA Report 섹션 비어 있음 | R1/R2/R3 | Coverage/
  Progression/Transfer/DAG 항목별 최소 QA 요약(체크 결과) 추가 |
  | 5 | Medium | “JSON”이 줄바꿈으로 깨져 strict JSON 파서에서 실패 가능
  | R1/R2/R3 | 문자열/수식/JSON을 단일 라인으로 정규화하고 JSON 유효성 검
  증 |

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - reviewer 요청 파일에 R1/R2 최종 패치를 인라인으로 포함(참고 위치:
    tasks/curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH1.log, tasks/
    curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH2.log).
  - R3 transfer_edges 패치는 공통 규칙대로 모든 노드/엣지에 confidence를
    포함하고, 레벨(min_level) 제안은 제거/회피.
  - QA에 “requires 추가분 사이클 없음” 및 “잠금 로직은 requires만” 확인
    문장을 명시.

  ## Review Result: [REQUEST_CHANGES]

  ### Summary

  현재 reviewer 요청 파일에는 R3 산출물만 포함되어 R1/R2 패치 병합·충돌
  해결을 수행할 수 없고, QA/DAG 검증 섹션도 비어 있어 승인할 수 없습니다.
  또한 R3 Graph Patch JSON은 add_nodes/add_edges에 confidence(0~1)가 누락
  되어 공통 규칙을 위반합니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  | Category | Pass/Fail | Notes |
  |----------|-----------|-------|
  | Coverage (R1) | Fail | R1 coverage_gap_report 및 missing_prereq_patch
  가 본 파일에 포함되어 있지 않음 |
  | Progression (R2) | Fail | R2 progression report 및 prereq_patch가 본
  파일에 포함되어 있지 않음 |
  | Transfer (R3) | Fail | Graph Patch JSON의 add_nodes/add_edges에
  confidence 누락 + QA report 미제공 |
  | DAG Integrity | Fail | requires 사이클/레벨/잠금(requires-only) 검증
  결과 미제공 |
  | Conflict Resolution | Fail | R1/R2 패치 부재로 충돌 규칙 적용 불가 |

  ### Issues Found (if REQUEST_CHANGES)

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - reviewer 요청 파일에 R1/R2 최종 패치를 인라인으로 포함(참고 위치:
    tasks/curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH1.log, tasks/
    curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH2.log).
  - R3 transfer_edges 패치는 공통 규칙대로 모든 노드/엣지에 confidence를
    포함하고, 레벨(min_level) 제안은 제거/회피.
  - QA에 “requires 추가분 사이클 없음” 및 “잠금 로직은 requires만” 확인
    문장을 명시.

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 패치를 한 파일에 모으고(특히 R2 requires) 충돌 규칙에
    따라 병합 결과(merged patch)를 산출.
  - “DAG Integrity”에 최소한의 자동/수동 점검 결과(사이클 없음, level 제
    안 없음, 잠금은 requires-only)를 명시.
  - 템플릿/트리플릿은 파라미터 범위·정답식·오답규칙이 기계적으로 읽히도록
    줄바꿈/표기 정규화.

  ## Review Result: REQUEST_CHANGES

  ### Summary

  R3(Transfer) 산출물은 템플릿/트리플릿/패치 형태가 비교적 완성도 있게 포
  함되어 있으나, 본 파일에 R1/R2 패치가 포함되지 않아 병합/충돌해결/
  DAG(requires) 검증을 수행할 수 없습니다. 또한 “Transfer Edge Analysis”
  표와 “Graph Patch JSON”이 1:1로 정합되지 않아 최종 적용 범위가 불명확합
  니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  | Category | Pass/Fail | Notes |
  |----------|-----------|-------|
  | Coverage (R1) | Fail | T1_1 티켓이 가리키는 R1 산출물(standards map/
  inventory/patch 후보)이 본 파일에 없음 |
  | Progression (R2) | Fail | requires 중심 선수관계 패치가 본 파일에 없
  음(잠금 로직 검증 불가) |
  | Transfer (R3) | Partial | 템플릿 10개/트리플릿 6세트, 엣지
  reason+confidence는 있음. 다만 표의 enables/analog_of 일부가 Graph
  Patch JSON에 누락되어 정합성 문제 |
  | DAG Integrity | Fail | R2 requires 부재로 사이클/잠금(requires-only)
  검증 불가(단, R3는 requires를 추가하지 않음) |
  | Conflict Resolution | Fail | R1/R2 미포함으로 충돌 규칙(requires→R2
  우선 등) 적용 불가 |

  ### Issues Found (if REQUEST_CHANGES)

  | # | Severity | Issue | Affected Researcher | Suggested Fix |
  |---|----------|-------|--------------------|--------------|
  | 1 | Critical | R1 산출물 미포함(T1_1 기준선: standards tags/개념 인벤
  토리/경계/alias 후보 등) | R1 / Packager | R1 결과를 본 “Combined
  Research Output”에 포함 |
  | 2 | Critical | R2 패치 미포함(requires 설계가 최종 잠금 로직이므로 필
  수) | R2 / Packager | R2 prereq_patch(requires 중심) 및 핵심 근거를 포
  함 |
  | 3 | High | “Transfer Edge Analysis”에 있는 enables/analog_of 중 일부
  가 “Graph Patch JSON”에 없음(최종 적용 범위 불명) | R3 | 표에 있는 엣지
  를 (a) 모두 add_edges에 포함하거나 (b) 제외 사유/이미 다른 패치에 존재
  함을 명시 |
  | 4 | High | QA Report 섹션 공란(체크리스트 검증 불가) | R1/R2/R3 |
  Coverage/Progression/Transfer/DAG 항목별 Pass/Fail 근거를 3~6줄로 요약
  추가 |
  | 5 | Medium | 참조 ID(예: STEP_SAMPLE_SPACE_BUILD, STEP_PERM_DERIVE,
  STEP_EVENT_OPS_INCL_EXCL 등)의 정의/출처가 이 파일만으로는 불명확 |
  R3 / Packager | “베이스 그래프에 존재” 또는 “R2 add_nodes에 포함”처럼
  출처를 명시(또는 누락 시 add_nodes로 포함) |

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 Graph Patch JSON을 한 파일에 모아 병합 패치(merged_by/
    review conflict_resolutions 포함)까지 생성.
  - R3는 “분석 표 ↔ 패치” 정합성을 맞추고, 최종적으로 추가되는 엣지/노드
    만 남도록 정리.
  - DAG Integrity 섹션에 최소 확인 문장: “requires 사이클 없음”, “level
    제안 없음”, “잠금은 requires만”을 명시.

  ### Summary

  현재 reviewer 요청 파일에는 R3 산출물만 포함되어 R1/R2 패치 병합·충돌
  해결을 수행할 수 없고, QA/DAG 검증 섹션도 비어 있어 승인할 수 없습니다.
  또한 R3 Graph Patch JSON은 add_nodes/add_edges에 confidence(0~1)가 누락
  되어 공통 규칙을 위반합니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  ## Review Result: REQUEST_CHANGES

  ### Summary

  R3(Transfer) 산출물은 템플릿/트리플릿/패치 형태가 비교적 완성도 있게 포
  함되어 있으나, 본 파일에 R1/R2 패치가 포함되지 않아 병합/충돌해결/
  DAG(requires) 검증을 수행할 수 없습니다. 또한 “Transfer Edge Analysis”
  표와 “Graph Patch JSON”이 1:1로 정합되지 않아 최종 적용 범위가 불명확합
  니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  | Category | Pass/Fail | Notes |
  |----------|-----------|-------|
  | Coverage (R1) | Fail | T1_1 티켓이 가리키는 R1 산출물(standards map/
  inventory/patch 후보)이 본 파일에 없음 |
  | Progression (R2) | Fail | requires 중심 선수관계 패치가 본 파일에 없
  음(잠금 로직 검증 불가) |
  | Transfer (R3) | Partial | 템플릿 10개/트리플릿 6세트, 엣지
  reason+confidence는 있음. 다만 표의 enables/analog_of 일부가 Graph
  Patch JSON에 누락되어 정합성 문제 |
  | DAG Integrity | Fail | R2 requires 부재로 사이클/잠금(requires-only)
  검증 불가(단, R3는 requires를 추가하지 않음) |
  | Conflict Resolution | Fail | R1/R2 미포함으로 충돌 규칙(requires→R2
  우선 등) 적용 불가 |

  ### Issues Found (if REQUEST_CHANGES)

  | # | Severity | Issue | Affected Researcher | Suggested Fix |

  R3 / Packager | “베이스 그래프에 존재” 또는 “R2 add_nodes에 포함”처럼
  출처를 명시(또는 누락 시 add_nodes로 포함) |

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 Graph Patch JSON을 한 파일에 모아 병합 패치(merged_by/
    review conflict_resolutions 포함)까지 생성.
  - R3는 “분석 표 ↔ 패치” 정합성을 맞추고, 최종적으로 추가되는 엣지/노드
    만 남도록 정리.
  - DAG Integrity 섹션에 최소 확인 문장: “requires 사이클 없음”, “level
    제안 없음”, “잠금은 requires만”을 명시.

  ## Review Result: REQUEST_CHANGES

  ### Summary

  R3(Transfer) 산출물은 템플릿/트리플릿/패치 형태가 비교적 완성도 있게 포
  함되어 있으나, 본 파일에 R1/R2 패치가 포함되지 않아 병합/충돌해결/
  DAG(requires) 검증을 수행할 수 없습니다. 또한 “Transfer Edge Analysis”
  표와 “Graph Patch JSON”이 1:1로 정합되지 않아 최종 적용 범위가 불명확합
  니다.

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 Graph Patch JSON을 한 파일에 모아 병합 패치(merged_by/
    review conflict_resolutions 포함)까지 생성.
  - R3는 “분석 표 ↔ 패치” 정합성을 맞추고, 최종적으로 추가되는 엣지/노드
    만 남도록 정리.
  - DAG Integrity 섹션에 최소 확인 문장: “requires 사이클 없음”, “level
    제안 없음”, “잠금은 requires만”을 명시.

  현재 reviewer 요청 파일에는 R3 산출물만 포함되어 R1/R2 패치 병합·충돌
  해결을 수행할 수 없고, QA/DAG 검증 섹션도 비어 있어 승인할 수 없습니다.
  또한 R3 Graph Patch JSON은 add_nodes/add_edges에 confidence(0~1)가 누락
  되어 공통 규칙을 위반합니다.

    tasks/curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH1.log, tasks/
    curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH2.log).
  - R3 transfer_edges 패치는 공통 규칙대로 모든 노드/엣지에 confidence를
    포함하고, 레벨(min_level) 제안은 제거/회피.
  - QA에 “requires 추가분 사이클 없음” 및 “잠금 로직은 requires만” 확인
    문장을 명시.

  ## Review Result: REQUEST_CHANGES

  ### Summary

  R3(Transfer) 산출물은 템플릿/트리플릿/패치 형태가 비교적 완성도 있게 포
  함되어 있으나, 본 파일에 R1/R2 패치가 포함되지 않아 병합/충돌해결/
  DAG(requires) 검증을 수행할 수 없습니다. 또한 “Transfer Edge Analysis”
  표와 “Graph Patch JSON”이 1:1로 정합되지 않아 최종 적용 범위가 불명확합
  니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  R3 / Packager | “베이스 그래프에 존재” 또는 “R2 add_nodes에 포함”처럼
  출처를 명시(또는 누락 시 add_nodes로 포함) |

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 Graph Patch JSON을 한 파일에 모아 병합 패치(merged_by/
    review conflict_resolutions 포함)까지 생성.
  - R3는 “분석 표 ↔ 패치” 정합성을 맞추고, 최종적으로 추가되는 엣지/노드
    만 남도록 정리.
  - DAG Integrity 섹션에 최소 확인 문장: “requires 사이클 없음”, “level
    제안 없음”, “잠금은 requires만”을 명시.

  ### Summary

  R3(Transfer) 산출물은 템플릿/트리플릿/패치 형태가 비교적 완성도 있게 포
  함되어 있으나, 본 파일에 R1/R2 패치가 포함되지 않아 병합/충돌해결/
  DAG(requires) 검증을 수행할 수 없습니다. 또한 “Transfer Edge Analysis”
  표와 “Graph Patch JSON”이 1:1로 정합되지 않아 최종 적용 범위가 불명확합
  니다.

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 Graph Patch JSON을 한 파일에 모아 병합 패치(merged_by/
    review conflict_resolutions 포함)까지 생성.
  - R3는 “분석 표 ↔ 패치” 정합성을 맞추고, 최종적으로 추가되는 엣지/노드
    만 남도록 정리.
  - DAG Integrity 섹션에 최소 확인 문장: “requires 사이클 없음”, “level
    제안 없음”, “잠금은 requires만”을 명시.

  ### Summary

  현재 reviewer 요청 파일에는 R3 산출물만 포함되어 R1/R2 패치 병합·충돌
  해결을 수행할 수 없고, QA/DAG 검증 섹션도 비어 있어 승인할 수 없습니다.
  또한 R3 Graph Patch JSON은 add_nodes/add_edges에 confidence(0~1)가 누락
  되어 공통 규칙을 위반합니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  | Category | Pass/Fail | Notes |
  |----------|-----------|-------|

  | Transfer (R3) | Fail | Graph Patch JSON의 add_nodes/add_edges에
  confidence 누락 + QA report 미제공 |
  | DAG Integrity | Fail | requires 사이클/레벨/잠금(requires-only) 검증
  결과 미제공 |
  | Conflict Resolution | Fail | R1/R2 패치 부재로 충돌 규칙 적용 불가 |

  ### Issues Found (if REQUEST_CHANGES)

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - reviewer 요청 파일에 R1/R2 최종 패치를 인라인으로 포함(참고 위치:
    tasks/curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH1.log, tasks/
    curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH2.log).
  - R3 transfer_edges 패치는 공통 규칙대로 모든 노드/엣지에 confidence를
    포함하고, 레벨(min_level) 제안은 제거/회피.
  - QA에 “requires 추가분 사이클 없음” 및 “잠금 로직은 requires만” 확인
    문장을 명시.

  ### Summary

  현재 파일에는 R3(Transfer) 산출물만 포함되어 R1/R2 패치 병합·충돌 해결
  및 requires 기반 DAG 검증을 수행할 수 없어 승인 불가입니다. R3 패치 자
  체는 confidence/notes를 포함해 전반 품질은 양호하나, 참조 노드 존재/스
  키마 일관성/QA가 보완되어야 합니다.

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 패치를 한 파일에 모으고(특히 R2 requires) 충돌 규칙에
    따라 병합 결과(merged patch)를 산출.
  - “DAG Integrity”에 최소한의 자동/수동 점검 결과(사이클 없음, level 제
    안 없음, 잠금은 requires-only)를 명시.
  - 템플릿/트리플릿은 파라미터 범위·정답식·오답규칙이 기계적으로 읽히도록
    줄바꿈/표기 정규화.

  ### Summary

  R3(Transfer) 산출물은 템플릿/트리플릿/패치 형태가 비교적 완성도 있게 포
  함되어 있으나, 본 파일에 R1/R2 패치가 포함되지 않아 병합/충돌해결/
  DAG(requires) 검증을 수행할 수 없습니다. 또한 “Transfer Edge Analysis”

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 Graph Patch JSON을 한 파일에 모아 병합 패치(merged_by/
    review conflict_resolutions 포함)까지 생성.
  - R3는 “분석 표 ↔ 패치” 정합성을 맞추고, 최종적으로 추가되는 엣지/노드
    만 남도록 정리.
  - DAG Integrity 섹션에 최소 확인 문장: “requires 사이클 없음”, “level
    제안 없음”, “잠금은 requires만”을 명시.

  ### Summary

  현재 reviewer 요청 파일에는 R3 산출물만 포함되어 R1/R2 패치 병합·충돌
  해결을 수행할 수 없고, QA/DAG 검증 섹션도 비어 있어 승인할 수 없습니다.
  또한 R3 Graph Patch JSON은 add_nodes/add_edges에 confidence(0~1)가 누락
  되어 공통 규칙을 위반합니다.

  ### Summary

  R3(Transfer) 산출물은 템플릿/트리플릿/패치 형태가 비교적 완성도 있게 포
  함되어 있으나, 본 파일에 R1/R2 패치가 포함되지 않아 병합/충돌해결/
  DAG(requires) 검증을 수행할 수 없습니다. 또한 “Transfer Edge Analysis”

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 Graph Patch JSON을 한 파일에 모아 병합 패치(merged_by/
    review conflict_resolutions 포함)까지 생성.
  - R3는 “분석 표 ↔ 패치” 정합성을 맞추고, 최종적으로 추가되는 엣지/노드
    만 남도록 정리.
  - DAG Integrity 섹션에 최소 확인 문장: “requires 사이클 없음”, “level
    제안 없음”, “잠금은 requires만”을 명시.

  ### Summary

  현재 파일의 “Combined Research Output”에는 R3(Transfer)만 포함되어
  R1(T1_1_1 요구 산출물)·R2 패치 병합/충돌해결 및 requires 기반 DAG 검증
  을 수행할 수 없습니다. R3 산출물 자체는 템플릿/트리플릿/근거+confidence
  를 갖췄지만, 통합 승인 조건을 충족하지 못합니다.

  ### Summary

  현재 reviewer 요청 파일에는 R3 산출물만 포함되어 R1/R2 패치 병합·충돌
  해결을 수행할 수 없고, QA/DAG 검증 섹션도 비어 있어 승인할 수 없습니다.
  또한 R3 Graph Patch JSON은 add_nodes/add_edges에 confidence(0~1)가 누락
  되어 공통 규칙을 위반합니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  | Category | Pass/Fail | Notes |
  |----------|-----------|-------|
  | Coverage (R1) | Fail | R1 coverage_gap_report 및 missing_prereq_patch
  가 본 파일에 포함되어 있지 않음 |
  | Progression (R2) | Fail | R2 progression report 및 prereq_patch가 본
  파일에 포함되어 있지 않음 |
  | Transfer (R3) | Fail | Graph Patch JSON의 add_nodes/add_edges에
  confidence 누락 + QA report 미제공 |
  | DAG Integrity | Fail | requires 사이클/레벨/잠금(requires-only) 검증
  결과 미제공 |
  | Conflict Resolution | Fail | R1/R2 패치 부재로 충돌 규칙 적용 불가 |

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - reviewer 요청 파일에 R1/R2 최종 패치를 인라인으로 포함(참고 위치:
    tasks/curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH1.log, tasks/
    curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH2.log).
  - R3 transfer_edges 패치는 공통 규칙대로 모든 노드/엣지에 confidence를
    포함하고, 레벨(min_level) 제안은 제거/회피.
  - QA에 “requires 추가분 사이클 없음” 및 “잠금 로직은 requires만” 확인
    문장을 명시.

  ### Summary

  현재 파일에는 R3(Transfer) 산출물만 포함되어 R1/R2 패치 병합·충돌 해결
  및 requires 기반 DAG 검증을 수행할 수 없어 승인 불가입니다. R3 패치 자
  체는 confidence/notes를 포함해 전반 품질은 양호하나, 참조 노드 존재/스
  키마 일관성/QA가 보완되어야 합니다.

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 패치를 한 파일에 모으고(특히 R2 requires) 충돌 규칙에
    따라 병합 결과(merged patch)를 산출.
  - “DAG Integrity”에 최소한의 자동/수동 점검 결과(사이클 없음, level 제
    안 없음, 잠금은 requires-only)를 명시.
  - 템플릿/트리플릿은 파라미터 범위·정답식·오답규칙이 기계적으로 읽히도록
    줄바꿈/표기 정규화.

  ### Summary

  R3(Transfer) 산출물은 템플릿/트리플릿/패치 형태가 비교적 완성도 있게 포
  함되어 있으나, 본 파일에 R1/R2 패치가 포함되지 않아 병합/충돌해결/
  DAG(requires) 검증을 수행할 수 없습니다. 또한 “Transfer Edge Analysis”
  표와 “Graph Patch JSON”이 1:1로 정합되지 않아 최종 적용 범위가 불명확합

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 Graph Patch JSON을 한 파일에 모아 병합 패치(merged_by/
    review conflict_resolutions 포함)까지 생성.
  - R3는 “분석 표 ↔ 패치” 정합성을 맞추고, 최종적으로 추가되는 엣지/노드
    만 남도록 정리.
  - DAG Integrity 섹션에 최소 확인 문장: “requires 사이클 없음”, “level
    제안 없음”, “잠금은 requires만”을 명시.

  - merge_aliases는 “동일 의미”만 묶고, 개념-규칙처럼 레벨이 다른 것은 분

  ### Summary

  현재 파일은 R3(Transfer) 산출물만 포함되어 있고, Ticket T1_1_1.md에서
  요구하는 R1 스키마/가드레일 및 R2(requires) 패치가 누락되어 병합·DAG 검
  증·충돌 해결을 완료할 수 없습니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  | Category | Pass/Fail | Notes |
  |----------|-----------|-------|
  | Coverage (R1) | Fail | T1_1_1.md 요구 산출물(단일 JSON 스키마/샘플/가
  드레일) 미포함 |
  | Progression (R2) | Fail | R2 micro 분해/requires 설계 패치 미포함(잠
  금 로직 검증 불가) |
  | Transfer (R3) | Pass | enables/analog_of에 reason+confidence 포함, 템
  플릿 11개/트리플릿 7세트, level 제안 없음 |
  | DAG Integrity | Fail | R2 requires 및 사이클 점검 결과 부재 |
  | Conflict Resolution | Fail | R1/R2 패치 부재로 우선순위 규칙 적용/병
  합 불가 |

  ### Issues Found (if REQUEST_CHANGES)

  | 5 | Medium | Graph Patch JSON 문자열이 줄바꿈으로 깨져 strict JSON 파
  서에서 실패 가능 | R3 / Packager | name_ko/reason을 단일 라인으로 정규
  화하고 JSON 유효성 검증 |

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1(스키마/가드레일) + R2(requires) + R3(transfer) 패치를 한 파일에 포
    함한 뒤, merged patch와 충돌 해결 로그까지 함께 제출.
  - DAG Integrity 섹션에 최소 검증 결과(사이클 없음/level 미제안/
    requires-only 잠금)를 명시.

  ### Summary

  현재 reviewer 요청 파일에는 R3 산출물만 포함되어 R1/R2 패치 병합·충돌
  해결을 수행할 수 없고, QA/DAG 검증 섹션도 비어 있어 승인할 수 없습니다.
  또한 R3 Graph Patch JSON은 add_nodes/add_edges에 confidence(0~1)가 누락
  되어 공통 규칙을 위반합니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - reviewer 요청 파일에 R1/R2 최종 패치를 인라인으로 포함(참고 위치:
    tasks/curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH1.log, tasks/
    curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH2.log).
  - R3 transfer_edges 패치는 공통 규칙대로 모든 노드/엣지에 confidence를
    포함하고, 레벨(min_level) 제안은 제거/회피.
  - QA에 “requires 추가분 사이클 없음” 및 “잠금 로직은 requires만” 확인
    문장을 명시.

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 패치를 한 파일에 모으고(특히 R2 requires) 충돌 규칙에
    따라 병합 결과(merged patch)를 산출.
  - “DAG Integrity”에 최소한의 자동/수동 점검 결과(사이클 없음, level 제
    안 없음, 잠금은 requires-only)를 명시.
  - 템플릿/트리플릿은 파라미터 범위·정답식·오답규칙이 기계적으로 읽히도록
    줄바꿈/표기 정규화.

  ### Summary

  R3(Transfer) 산출물은 템플릿/트리플릿/패치 형태가 비교적 완성도 있게 포
  함되어 있으나, 본 파일에 R1/R2 패치가 포함되지 않아 병합/충돌해결/
  DAG(requires) 검증을 수행할 수 없습니다. 또한 “Transfer Edge Analysis”
  표와 “Graph Patch JSON”이 1:1로 정합되지 않아 최종 적용 범위가 불명확합
  니다.

  R3 / Packager | “베이스 그래프에 존재” 또는 “R2 add_nodes에 포함”처럼
  출처를 명시(또는 누락 시 add_nodes로 포함) |

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 Graph Patch JSON을 한 파일에 모아 병합 패치(merged_by/
    review conflict_resolutions 포함)까지 생성.
  - R3는 “분석 표 ↔ 패치” 정합성을 맞추고, 최종적으로 추가되는 엣지/노드
    만 남도록 정리.
  - DAG Integrity 섹션에 최소 확인 문장: “requires 사이클 없음”, “level
    제안 없음”, “잠금은 requires만”을 명시.

  ### Summary

  현재 reviewer 요청 파일에는 R3 산출물만 포함되어 R1/R2 패치 병합·충돌
  해결을 수행할 수 없고, QA/DAG 검증 섹션도 비어 있어 승인할 수 없습니다.
  또한 R3 Graph Patch JSON은 add_nodes/add_edges에 confidence(0~1)가 누락
  되어 공통 규칙을 위반합니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 패치를 한 파일에 모으고(특히 R2 requires) 충돌 규칙에
    따라 병합 결과(merged patch)를 산출.
  - “DAG Integrity”에 최소한의 자동/수동 점검 결과(사이클 없음, level 제
    안 없음, 잠금은 requires-only)를 명시.
  - 템플릿/트리플릿은 파라미터 범위·정답식·오답규칙이 기계적으로 읽히도록
    줄바꿈/표기 정규화.

  ### Summary

  R3(Transfer) 산출물은 템플릿/트리플릿/패치 형태가 비교적 완성도 있게 포
  함되어 있으나, 본 파일에 R1/R2 패치가 포함되지 않아 병합/충돌해결/
  DAG(requires) 검증을 수행할 수 없습니다. 또한 “Transfer Edge Analysis”
  표와 “Graph Patch JSON”이 1:1로 정합되지 않아 최종 적용 범위가 불명확합

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 Graph Patch JSON을 한 파일에 모아 병합 패치(merged_by/
    review conflict_resolutions 포함)까지 생성.
  - R3는 “분석 표 ↔ 패치” 정합성을 맞추고, 최종적으로 추가되는 엣지/노드
    만 남도록 정리.
  - DAG Integrity 섹션에 최소 확인 문장: “requires 사이클 없음”, “level
    제안 없음”, “잠금은 requires만”을 명시.

  ### Summary

  R3 전이/문항 템플릿/동형 트리플릿은 요구조건을 충족하지만, R1(T1_1)·R2
  산출물이 본 파일에 없어 merged patch 생성·DAG(requires) 무결성 검증·충
  돌 해결을 수행할 수 없습니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 패치를 한 파일에 모으고(특히 R2 requires), 충돌 규칙에
    따라 merged patch까지 산출.
  - DAG Integrity에 “requires 사이클 없음 / level 제안 없음 / 잠금은
    requires-only”를 명시.

  ### Summary

  현재 파일의 “Combined Research Output”에는 R3(Transfer)만 포함되어
  R1(T1_1_1 요구 산출물)·R2 패치 병합/충돌해결 및 requires 기반 DAG 검증
  을 수행할 수 없습니다. R3 산출물 자체는 템플릿/트리플릿/근거+confidence
  를 갖췄지만, 통합 승인 조건을 충족하지 못합니다.

  ## Review Result: [REQUEST_CHANGES]

  ### Summary

  현재 reviewer 요청 파일에는 R3 산출물만 포함되어 R1/R2 패치 병합·충돌
  해결을 수행할 수 없고, QA/DAG 검증 섹션도 비어 있어 승인할 수 없습니다.
  또한 R3 Graph Patch JSON은 add_nodes/add_edges에 confidence(0~1)가 누락
  되어 공통 규칙을 위반합니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - reviewer 요청 파일에 R1/R2 최종 패치를 인라인으로 포함(참고 위치:
    tasks/curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH1.log, tasks/
    curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH2.log).
  - R3 transfer_edges 패치는 공통 규칙대로 모든 노드/엣지에 confidence를
    포함하고, 레벨(min_level) 제안은 제거/회피.
  - QA에 “requires 추가분 사이클 없음” 및 “잠금 로직은 requires만” 확인
    문장을 명시.

  체는 confidence/notes를 포함해 전반 품질은 양호하나, 참조 노드 존재/스
  키마 일관성/QA가 보완되어야 합니다.

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 패치를 한 파일에 모으고(특히 R2 requires) 충돌 규칙에
    따라 병합 결과(merged patch)를 산출.
  - “DAG Integrity”에 최소한의 자동/수동 점검 결과(사이클 없음, level 제
    안 없음, 잠금은 requires-only)를 명시.
  - 템플릿/트리플릿은 파라미터 범위·정답식·오답규칙이 기계적으로 읽히도록
    줄바꿈/표기 정규화.

  ### Summary

  R3(Transfer) 산출물은 템플릿/트리플릿/패치 형태가 비교적 완성도 있게 포
  함되어 있으나, 본 파일에 R1/R2 패치가 포함되지 않아 병합/충돌해결/
  DAG(requires) 검증을 수행할 수 없습니다. 또한 “Transfer Edge Analysis”
  표와 “Graph Patch JSON”이 1:1로 정합되지 않아 최종 적용 범위가 불명확합

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 Graph Patch JSON을 한 파일에 모아 병합 패치(merged_by/
    review conflict_resolutions 포함)까지 생성.
  - R3는 “분석 표 ↔ 패치” 정합성을 맞추고, 최종적으로 추가되는 엣지/노드
    만 남도록 정리.
  - DAG Integrity 섹션에 최소 확인 문장: “requires 사이클 없음”, “level
    제안 없음”, “잠금은 requires만”을 명시.

  ### Summary

  R3 전이/문항 템플릿/동형 트리플릿은 요구조건을 충족하지만, R1(T1_1)·R2
  산출물이 본 파일에 없어 merged patch 생성·DAG(requires) 무결성 검증·충
  돌 해결을 수행할 수 없습니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 패치를 한 파일에 모으고(특히 R2 requires), 충돌 규칙에
    따라 merged patch까지 산출.
  - DAG Integrity에 “requires 사이클 없음 / level 제안 없음 / 잠금은
    requires-only”를 명시.

  ### Summary

  현재 파일의 “Combined Research Output”에는 R3(Transfer)만 포함되어
  R1(T1_1_1 요구 산출물)·R2 패치 병합/충돌해결 및 requires 기반 DAG 검증
  을 수행할 수 없습니다. R3 산출물 자체는 템플릿/트리플릿/근거+confidence
  를 갖췄지만, 통합 승인 조건을 충족하지 못합니다.

  ## Review Result: [REQUEST_CHANGES]

  ### Summary

  현재 reviewer 요청 파일에는 R3 산출물만 포함되어 R1/R2 패치 병합·충돌
  해결을 수행할 수 없고, QA/DAG 검증 섹션도 비어 있어 승인할 수 없습니다.
  또한 R3 Graph Patch JSON은 add_nodes/add_edges에 confidence(0~1)가 누락
  되어 공통 규칙을 위반합니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  | Category | Pass/Fail | Notes |
  |----------|-----------|-------|

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - reviewer 요청 파일에 R1/R2 최종 패치를 인라인으로 포함(참고 위치:
    tasks/curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH1.log, tasks/
    curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH2.log).
  - R3 transfer_edges 패치는 공통 규칙대로 모든 노드/엣지에 confidence를
    포함하고, 레벨(min_level) 제안은 제거/회피.
  - QA에 “requires 추가분 사이클 없음” 및 “잠금 로직은 requires만” 확인
    문장을 명시.

  ### Summary

  현재 파일에는 R3(Transfer) 산출물만 포함되어 R1/R2 패치 병합·충돌 해결
  및 requires 기반 DAG 검증을 수행할 수 없어 승인 불가입니다. R3 패치 자
  체는 confidence/notes를 포함해 전반 품질은 양호하나, 참조 노드 존재/스
  키마 일관성/QA가 보완되어야 합니다.

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 패치를 한 파일에 모으고(특히 R2 requires) 충돌 규칙에
    따라 병합 결과(merged patch)를 산출.
  - “DAG Integrity”에 최소한의 자동/수동 점검 결과(사이클 없음, level 제
    안 없음, 잠금은 requires-only)를 명시.
  - 템플릿/트리플릿은 파라미터 범위·정답식·오답규칙이 기계적으로 읽히도록
    줄바꿈/표기 정규화.

  ### Summary

  R3(Transfer) 산출물은 템플릿/트리플릿/패치 형태가 비교적 완성도 있게 포
  함되어 있으나, 본 파일에 R1/R2 패치가 포함되지 않아 병합/충돌해결/
  DAG(requires) 검증을 수행할 수 없습니다. 또한 “Transfer Edge Analysis”
  표와 “Graph Patch JSON”이 1:1로 정합되지 않아 최종 적용 범위가 불명확합
  니다.

  R3 / Packager | “베이스 그래프에 존재” 또는 “R2 add_nodes에 포함”처럼
  출처를 명시(또는 누락 시 add_nodes로 포함) |

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 Graph Patch JSON을 한 파일에 모아 병합 패치(merged_by/
    review conflict_resolutions 포함)까지 생성.
  - R3는 “분석 표 ↔ 패치” 정합성을 맞추고, 최종적으로 추가되는 엣지/노드
    만 남도록 정리.
  - DAG Integrity 섹션에 최소 확인 문장: “requires 사이클 없음”, “level
    제안 없음”, “잠금은 requires만”을 명시.

  ## Review Result: [REQUEST_CHANGES]

  ### Summary

  현재 reviewer 요청 파일에는 R3 산출물만 포함되어 R1/R2 패치 병합·충돌
  해결을 수행할 수 없고, QA/DAG 검증 섹션도 비어 있어 승인할 수 없습니다.
  또한 R3 Graph Patch JSON은 add_nodes/add_edges에 confidence(0~1)가 누락
  되어 공통 규칙을 위반합니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  | Category | Pass/Fail | Notes |
  |----------|-----------|-------|
  | Coverage (R1) | Fail | R1 coverage_gap_report 및 missing_prereq_patch
  가 본 파일에 포함되어 있지 않음 |
  | Progression (R2) | Fail | R2 progression report 및 prereq_patch가 본
  파일에 포함되어 있지 않음 |
  | Transfer (R3) | Fail | Graph Patch JSON의 add_nodes/add_edges에
  confidence 누락 + QA report 미제공 |
  | DAG Integrity | Fail | requires 사이클/레벨/잠금(requires-only) 검증
  결과 미제공 |
  | Conflict Resolution | Fail | R1/R2 패치 부재로 충돌 규칙 적용 불가 |

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - reviewer 요청 파일에 R1/R2 최종 패치를 인라인으로 포함(참고 위치:
    tasks/curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH1.log, tasks/
    curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH2.log).
  - R3 transfer_edges 패치는 공통 규칙대로 모든 노드/엣지에 confidence를
    포함하고, 레벨(min_level) 제안은 제거/회피.
  - QA에 “requires 추가분 사이클 없음” 및 “잠금 로직은 requires만” 확인
    문장을 명시.

  ### Summary

  현재 파일에는 R3(Transfer) 산출물만 포함되어 R1/R2 패치 병합·충돌 해결
  및 requires 기반 DAG 검증을 수행할 수 없어 승인 불가입니다. R3 패치 자
  체는 confidence/notes를 포함해 전반 품질은 양호하나, 참조 노드 존재/스
  키마 일관성/QA가 보완되어야 합니다.

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 패치를 한 파일에 모으고(특히 R2 requires) 충돌 규칙에
    따라 병합 결과(merged patch)를 산출.
  - “DAG Integrity”에 최소한의 자동/수동 점검 결과(사이클 없음, level 제
    안 없음, 잠금은 requires-only)를 명시.
  - 템플릿/트리플릿은 파라미터 범위·정답식·오답규칙이 기계적으로 읽히도록
    줄바꿈/표기 정규화.

  ### Summary

  R3(Transfer) 산출물은 템플릿/트리플릿/패치 형태가 비교적 완성도 있게 포
  함되어 있으나, 본 파일에 R1/R2 패치가 포함되지 않아 병합/충돌해결/
  DAG(requires) 검증을 수행할 수 없습니다. 또한 “Transfer Edge Analysis”
  표와 “Graph Patch JSON”이 1:1로 정합되지 않아 최종 적용 범위가 불명확합
  니다.

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 Graph Patch JSON을 한 파일에 모아 병합 패치(merged_by/
    review conflict_resolutions 포함)까지 생성.
  - R3는 “분석 표 ↔ 패치” 정합성을 맞추고, 최종적으로 추가되는 엣지/노드
    만 남도록 정리.
  - DAG Integrity 섹션에 최소 확인 문장: “requires 사이클 없음”, “level
    제안 없음”, “잠금은 requires만”을 명시.

  - merge_aliases는 “동일 의미”만 묶고, 개념-규칙처럼 레벨이 다른 것은 분

  ### Summary

  현재 파일은 R3(Transfer) 산출물만 포함되어 있고, Ticket T1_1_1.md에서
  요구하는 R1 스키마/가드레일 및 R2(requires) 패치가 누락되어 병합·DAG 검
  증·충돌 해결을 완료할 수 없습니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  | Category | Pass/Fail | Notes |
  |----------|-----------|-------|
  | Coverage (R1) | Fail | T1_1_1.md 요구 산출물(단일 JSON 스키마/샘플/가
  드레일) 미포함 |
  | Progression (R2) | Fail | R2 micro 분해/requires 설계 패치 미포함(잠
  금 로직 검증 불가) |
  | Transfer (R3) | Pass | enables/analog_of에 reason+confidence 포함, 템
  플릿 11개/트리플릿 7세트, level 제안 없음 |
  | DAG Integrity | Fail | R2 requires 및 사이클 점검 결과 부재 |
  | Conflict Resolution | Fail | R1/R2 패치 부재로 우선순위 규칙 적용/병
  합 불가 |

  ### Issues Found (if REQUEST_CHANGES)

  | # | Severity | Issue | Affected Researcher | Suggested Fix |
  |---|----------|-------|--------------------|--------------|
  | 1 | Critical | Ticket(T1_1_1)과 Combined Output 불일치(R1 스키마/가드
  레일이 아닌 R3 전이 중심) | R1 / Packager | R1 출력(스키마 JSON + 샘플
  + boundary/id rules)을 본 파일에 포함하거나, 올바른 티켓/스코프로 교체
  |
  | 2 | Critical | R2 산출물/requires 패치 누락으로 DAG 잠금 검증 불가 |
  R2 / Packager | R2 prereq_patch(requires) 및 핵심 근거/브릿지 요약 포함
  |
  | 3 | High | QA Report 공란 | R1/R2/R3 | 체크리스트별 Pass/Fail 근거(사
  이클 없음, level 미제안, requires-only 잠금 등) 기입 |
  | 4 | Medium | Transfer Edge Analysis 표에서 |A|/|S|가 테이블 구분자(|)
  와 충돌해 렌더링/파싱이 깨질 수 있음 | R3 | 표/문장에서는 A/S 또는 \\|
  A\\|/\\|S\\|처럼 이스케이프/표기 변경 |
  | 5 | Medium | Graph Patch JSON 문자열이 줄바꿈으로 깨져 strict JSON 파
  서에서 실패 가능 | R3 / Packager | name_ko/reason을 단일 라인으로 정규
  화하고 JSON 유효성 검증 |

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1(스키마/가드레일) + R2(requires) + R3(transfer) 패치를 한 파일에 포
    함한 뒤, merged patch와 충돌 해결 로그까지 함께 제출.
  - DAG Integrity 섹션에 최소 검증 결과(사이클 없음/level 미제안/
    requires-only 잠금)를 명시.

  ### Summary

  현재 reviewer 요청 파일에는 R3 산출물만 포함되어 R1/R2 패치 병합·충돌
  해결을 수행할 수 없고, QA/DAG 검증 섹션도 비어 있어 승인할 수 없습니다.
  또한 R3 Graph Patch JSON은 add_nodes/add_edges에 confidence(0~1)가 누락
  되어 공통 규칙을 위반합니다.

  ### Checklist Results

    tasks/curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH1.log, tasks/
    curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH2.log).
  - R3 transfer_edges 패치는 공통 규칙대로 모든 노드/엣지에 confidence를
    포함하고, 레벨(min_level) 제안은 제거/회피.
  - QA에 “requires 추가분 사이클 없음” 및 “잠금 로직은 requires만” 확인
    문장을 명시.

  체는 confidence/notes를 포함해 전반 품질은 양호하나, 참조 노드 존재/스

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 패치를 한 파일에 모으고(특히 R2 requires) 충돌 규칙에
    따라 병합 결과(merged patch)를 산출.
  - “DAG Integrity”에 최소한의 자동/수동 점검 결과(사이클 없음, level 제
    안 없음, 잠금은 requires-only)를 명시.
  - 템플릿/트리플릿은 파라미터 범위·정답식·오답규칙이 기계적으로 읽히도록
    줄바꿈/표기 정규화.

  ### Summary

  R3(Transfer) 산출물은 템플릿/트리플릿/패치 형태가 비교적 완성도 있게 포
  함되어 있으나, 본 파일에 R1/R2 패치가 포함되지 않아 병합/충돌해결/
  DAG(requires) 검증을 수행할 수 없습니다. 또한 “Transfer Edge Analysis”

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 Graph Patch JSON을 한 파일에 모아 병합 패치(merged_by/
    review conflict_resolutions 포함)까지 생성.
  - R3는 “분석 표 ↔ 패치” 정합성을 맞추고, 최종적으로 추가되는 엣지/노드
    만 남도록 정리.
  - DAG Integrity 섹션에 최소 확인 문장: “requires 사이클 없음”, “level
    제안 없음”, “잠금은 requires만”을 명시.

  ### Summary

  현재 파일의 “Combined Research Output”에는 R3(Transfer)만 포함되어
  R1(T1_1_1 요구 산출물)·R2 패치 병합/충돌해결 및 requires 기반 DAG 검증
  을 수행할 수 없습니다. R3 산출물 자체는 템플릿/트리플릿/근거+confidence
  를 갖췄지만, 통합 승인 조건을 충족하지 못합니다.

  ### Summary

  R3(Transfer) 산출물은 전이 엣지/템플릿/트리플릿이 비교적 충실하지만,
  Ticket T1_1_1.md 기준 R1 스키마/가드레일 산출물과 R2(requires) 패치가
  누락되어 통합 병합 및 DAG 검증을 완료할 수 없습니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  | Category | Pass/Fail | Notes |
  |----------|-----------|-------|
  | Coverage (R1) | Fail | T1_1_1 요구 산출물(단일 JSON 스키마/샘플/
  boundary/id rules) 미포함 |

  | Transfer (R3) | Pass | enables/analog_of에 근거+confidence 포함, 템플
  릿 3개 상세+트리플릿 6세트로 요구조건 충족 |
  | DAG Integrity | Fail | requires 기반 사이클/level/잠금(requires-only)
  검증 결과 미제공 |
  | Conflict Resolution | Fail | R1/R2 패치 부재로 규칙 적용 및 merged
  patch 생성 불가 |

  ### Issues Found (if REQUEST_CHANGES)

  ### Summary

  현재 reviewer 요청 파일에는 R3 산출물만 포함되어 R1/R2 패치 병합·충돌
  해결을 수행할 수 없고, QA/DAG 검증 섹션도 비어 있어 승인할 수 없습니다.
  또한 R3 Graph Patch JSON은 add_nodes/add_edges에 confidence(0~1)가 누락
  되어 공통 규칙을 위반합니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  | Category | Pass/Fail | Notes |
  |----------|-----------|-------|

  | DAG Integrity | Fail | requires 사이클/레벨/잠금(requires-only) 검증
  결과 미제공 |
  | Conflict Resolution | Fail | R1/R2 패치 부재로 충돌 규칙 적용 불가 |

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - reviewer 요청 파일에 R1/R2 최종 패치를 인라인으로 포함(참고 위치:
    tasks/curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH1.log, tasks/
    curriculum_skilltree_research_v1/RESEARCH2.log).
  - R3 transfer_edges 패치는 공통 규칙대로 모든 노드/엣지에 confidence를
    포함하고, 레벨(min_level) 제안은 제거/회피.
  - QA에 “requires 추가분 사이클 없음” 및 “잠금 로직은 requires만” 확인
    문장을 명시.

  ### Summary

  현재 파일에는 R3(Transfer) 산출물만 포함되어 R1/R2 패치 병합·충돌 해결
  및 requires 기반 DAG 검증을 수행할 수 없어 승인 불가입니다. R3 패치 자
  체는 confidence/notes를 포함해 전반 품질은 양호하나, 참조 노드 존재/스
  키마 일관성/QA가 보완되어야 합니다.

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 패치를 한 파일에 모으고(특히 R2 requires) 충돌 규칙에
    따라 병합 결과(merged patch)를 산출.
  - “DAG Integrity”에 최소한의 자동/수동 점검 결과(사이클 없음, level 제
    안 없음, 잠금은 requires-only)를 명시.
  - 템플릿/트리플릿은 파라미터 범위·정답식·오답규칙이 기계적으로 읽히도록
    줄바꿈/표기 정규화.

  ### Summary

  R3(Transfer) 산출물은 템플릿/트리플릿/패치 형태가 비교적 완성도 있게 포
  함되어 있으나, 본 파일에 R1/R2 패치가 포함되지 않아 병합/충돌해결/
  DAG(requires) 검증을 수행할 수 없습니다. 또한 “Transfer Edge Analysis”

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1/R2/R3 최종 Graph Patch JSON을 한 파일에 모아 병합 패치(merged_by/
    review conflict_resolutions 포함)까지 생성.
  - R3는 “분석 표 ↔ 패치” 정합성을 맞추고, 최종적으로 추가되는 엣지/노드
    만 남도록 정리.
  - DAG Integrity 섹션에 최소 확인 문장: “requires 사이클 없음”, “level
    제안 없음”, “잠금은 requires만”을 명시.

  ### Summary

  현재 파일은 R3(Transfer) 산출물만 포함되어 있고, Ticket T1_1_1.md에서
  요구하는 R1 스키마/가드레일 및 R2(requires) 패치가 누락되어 병합·DAG 검
  증·충돌 해결을 완료할 수 없습니다.

  ### Summary

  R3(Transfer) 산출물은 전이 엣지/템플릿(12개)/트리플릿(6세트)까지 갖춰
  완성도가 높지만, Ticket T1_1_1.md 기준 R1 스키마/가드레일 산출물과
  R2(requires) 패치가 누락되어 병합·DAG 무결성 검증·충돌 해결을 완료할 수
  없습니다.

  ### Checklist Results

  | Category | Pass/Fail | Notes |
  |----------|-----------|-------|
  | Coverage (R1) | Fail | T1_1_1 요구 산출물(스키마 JSON + 샘플 +
  boundary/id rules) 미포함 |
  | Progression (R2) | Fail | R2 micro 분해 + requires 설계/패치 미포함
  (잠금 로직 검증 불가) |
  | Transfer (R3) | Pass | enables/analog_of에 근거+confidence 포함, 템플
  릿 12개/트리플릿 6세트 충족 |
  | DAG Integrity | Fail | R2 requires 및 사이클/level/잠금(requires-
  only) 검증 결과 미제공 |
  | Conflict Resolution | Fail | R1/R2 패치 부재로 규칙 적용 및 merged
  patch 생성 불가 |

  ### Issues Found (if REQUEST_CHANGES)

  | 5 | Low | analog_of 중 “게이트 패턴”류(conf 0.58) 오해 소지 | R3 | 패
  턴 유사성(메타)임을 notes/QA에 명시하거나 제거 고려 |

  ### Recommendations for Next Iteration

  - R1(스키마/가드레일) + R2(requires) + R3(transfer) 패치를 한 파일에 포
    함한 뒤, 충돌 규칙에 따라 merged patch를 산출하고 DAG Integrity(사이
    클/level/잠금) 결과를 명시.
